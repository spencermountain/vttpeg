WEBVTT

00:22.908 --> 00:24.535
Linda Johnson is
a political liability.

00:24.618 --> 00:25.786
Harry, I need her.

00:25.828 --> 00:26.953
I can understand now

00:27.036 --> 00:28.287
why Nelson
finds you repugnant.

00:28.329 --> 00:30.248
Oh, you're wonderful,
wonderful, all of you!

00:30.331 --> 00:31.874
Thank you so very much.
Thank you.

00:32.041 --> 00:34.127
Any ltalians in
your family Mafia?

00:34.210 --> 00:35.795
Look at this watch.

00:36.003 --> 00:38.339
It will be your job
to locate this lunatic,

00:38.381 --> 00:39.382
whoever he is.

00:39.549 --> 00:41.175
Well, I mean
hired killers are crazy.

01:13.291 --> 01:14.333
Now come on, people.

01:14.417 --> 01:16.294
In county office,
I gave them trouble

01:16.377 --> 01:18.171
on a local level
for four straight years.

01:18.254 --> 01:19.505
As a United States Senator,

01:19.589 --> 01:21.424
I'd be giving them
twice as hard a time,

01:21.507 --> 01:23.259
and on
a national level to boot.

01:23.342 --> 01:25.011
Of course,
they're threatening my life,

01:25.052 --> 01:26.262
I'm threatening theirs.

01:26.345 --> 01:28.890
Mr. Hayward, sir.
Rick Stevens, UPl.

01:28.973 --> 01:31.392
Sir, your request here today
for police protection

01:31.476 --> 01:32.852
against
the criminal elements...

01:32.894 --> 01:34.645
Oh, let me make
myself clear.

01:35.229 --> 01:38.483
I am here merely to report
to the proper authorities

01:38.566 --> 01:40.568
the fact of my having
received those threats.

01:40.651 --> 01:43.571
Now, I've accepted this, uh,
police protection reluctantly

01:43.654 --> 01:45.865
and only at
the continued insistence

01:45.948 --> 01:47.533
of concerned individuals.

01:47.575 --> 01:49.869
Sir, isn't that rather
a cavalier attitude?

01:49.911 --> 01:52.413
It seems to me that anyone,
much less a public official,

01:52.497 --> 01:54.624
who's been receiving
threatening letters...

01:54.707 --> 01:56.709
No, I will not be
intimated by these threats,

01:56.793 --> 01:58.544
I will continue to campaign.

01:58.628 --> 02:01.047
Well, will you limit
your public appearances?

02:01.089 --> 02:02.465
Not in the slightest.

02:02.548 --> 02:04.884
I believe that any candidate
for high public office,

02:05.009 --> 02:07.345
who has pledged himself,
as have I,

02:07.595 --> 02:09.722
to the eradication
of organized crime

02:09.889 --> 02:12.058
and all the filth
that it engenders

02:12.100 --> 02:14.852
had better possess
whatever selfless dedication,

02:14.936 --> 02:18.272
whatever sheer guts
may be required to stand alone

02:18.606 --> 02:20.108
with his only
protection being

02:20.191 --> 02:21.818
the courage of
his convictions

02:22.068 --> 02:24.069
regardless of personal risk.

02:24.152 --> 02:25.904
This is what I believe, sir.

02:27.572 --> 02:30.158
Thomas Jefferson
couldn't have said it better.

02:30.826 --> 02:33.078
So with the election
less than a week away,

02:33.161 --> 02:35.497
Nelson Hayward,
candidate for the U.S. Senate,

02:35.580 --> 02:38.250
in a race to fill the seat
of the late Harold Lench

02:38.291 --> 02:41.086
will have round-the-clock
police protection following

02:41.169 --> 02:43.797
the reported threats
against his life.

02:45.841 --> 02:49.052
I think I just clinched
your boyfriend's election.

02:49.302 --> 02:50.429
I can understand now

02:50.470 --> 02:52.222
why Nelson
finds you repugnant.

02:52.848 --> 02:54.933
You know, you shouldn't
have turned that off.

02:55.016 --> 02:57.144
I'm expecting
a bulletin any minute.

02:58.979 --> 03:00.272
Like what?

03:00.814 --> 03:02.441
Like,
what senatorial candidate

03:02.524 --> 03:04.151
has been using
his beach house

03:04.234 --> 03:07.112
to entertain his
own wife's secretary.

03:08.989 --> 03:11.783
Nelson is not
happily married.

03:11.825 --> 03:13.326
Look, I didn't tell
you to come here

03:13.410 --> 03:14.453
to discuss
his marriage.

03:14.494 --> 03:16.121
I told you to come here
to discuss

03:16.163 --> 03:17.289
his affair with you.

03:17.372 --> 03:18.832
That's none of
your business.

03:18.957 --> 03:20.375
Let go of him.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.968
It's time you called.
Listen, Gomez,

03:30.010 --> 03:31.803
how about
that endorsement?

03:32.512 --> 03:34.723
Let go now,
Linda, today.

03:36.141 --> 03:38.143
I happen to be
in love with him.

03:38.185 --> 03:39.186
If you were,

03:39.227 --> 03:40.812
you wouldn't risk
ruining his chances.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.314
Listen, Gomez,

03:42.355 --> 03:44.983
we want that endorsement
by noon tomorrow.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.152
Now save that bleeding-hearts
minority speech

03:47.194 --> 03:49.279
for those 3,000
creeps you control.

03:50.113 --> 03:51.823
Now if you like, uh,
heading that little

03:51.907 --> 03:53.325
sweetheart union
of yours...

03:53.366 --> 03:55.619
Hold on one second.
Hey, use your head.

03:55.702 --> 03:57.746
He's gonna be in here
any minute, surrounded by

03:57.829 --> 03:59.831
a covey of cops,
maybe newsmen.

03:59.873 --> 04:01.208
Now if you
won't get out of town,

04:01.291 --> 04:02.501
at least
get out of here.

04:02.542 --> 04:04.086
Your job's with
the candidate's wife,

04:04.169 --> 04:05.295
not the candidate.

04:05.378 --> 04:07.506
All right, Harry,
I will leave for now,

04:07.589 --> 04:10.008
but I won't stay away
unless Nelson tells me to.

04:10.717 --> 04:11.968
You ought to know
by now

04:12.052 --> 04:14.096
that Nelson does
whatever I tell him to do.

04:14.179 --> 04:16.139
Well, I want to hear it
from him!

04:16.223 --> 04:17.641
Have him call me.

04:44.208 --> 04:46.210
Uh, I'm leaving
Sgt. Rojas down here

04:46.293 --> 04:47.586
to keep an eye
on your car.

04:58.764 --> 05:01.267
Um, I'll be standing by
if you need anything, sir.

05:01.350 --> 05:03.269
Thank you, Sergeant.

05:03.310 --> 05:04.353
How'd it go?

05:04.437 --> 05:05.396
Made all three networks.

05:05.479 --> 05:07.398
It's the greatest stunt
I ever thought of.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.567
You know, all that garbage
about your life

05:09.608 --> 05:11.694
being threatened
really pulls the old sympathy.

05:11.777 --> 05:13.070
How was I?

05:13.112 --> 05:14.321
You'd have been
better off

05:14.405 --> 05:16.449
without that reference
to your guts.

05:16.532 --> 05:19.076
Humility, Nelson,
humility.

05:19.535 --> 05:21.662
Servant of the people.

05:21.912 --> 05:23.914
If I could do
your talking for you

05:23.956 --> 05:25.958
as well as your thinking,
I'd make you president,

05:26.125 --> 05:27.543
not just senator.

05:49.148 --> 05:51.358
Murray, can you talk?

05:52.443 --> 05:54.487
Listen, I, uh, tried
muscling Gomez

05:54.570 --> 05:56.489
into that endorsement,
but he wouldn't bend.

05:56.530 --> 05:58.741
I'll tell you what
I want you to do.

05:59.325 --> 06:01.077
Dig up a couple
of Chicano kids,

06:01.160 --> 06:02.161
slip them a few bucks.

06:02.244 --> 06:04.789
Let them figure you're working
for the opposition.

06:04.830 --> 06:07.458
Get them to bust up
our East LA campaign office.

06:08.375 --> 06:09.627
Bye-bye.

06:10.795 --> 06:13.756
Here is your ecology speech
for tomorrow morning.

06:13.839 --> 06:15.674
Gillie did
a terrific job on it

06:15.758 --> 06:16.967
and I just improved it.

06:17.676 --> 06:20.970
Read it word for word
and no ad libs, please.

06:21.888 --> 06:23.181
Whose lipstick is this?

06:23.264 --> 06:25.100
Linda's.
I asked her over.

06:25.183 --> 06:26.142
Guess why?

06:26.851 --> 06:28.311
To tell her
to get out of my life.

06:28.394 --> 06:29.479
You guessed.

06:29.521 --> 06:31.272
Harry, stay out of
my private life!

06:31.356 --> 06:32.941
You don't have
any private life.

06:33.024 --> 06:34.109
I'm telling you...

06:34.192 --> 06:35.193
No, I'm tellin' you.

06:35.276 --> 06:37.195
I've put too much
into getting you

06:37.278 --> 06:38.321
where you are now

06:38.363 --> 06:40.073
to take a chance
on blowing it.

06:40.156 --> 06:41.825
Now whatever affects
your political life

06:41.908 --> 06:42.867
affects me,

06:42.951 --> 06:44.828
and Linda Johnson is
a political liability.

06:44.869 --> 06:45.870
Harry, I need her.

06:45.954 --> 06:47.664
You don't need
anybody but me.

06:47.747 --> 06:49.624
You could get rid of
anybody but me

06:49.707 --> 06:51.501
because I know where
the bodies are buried.

06:51.584 --> 06:53.169
Nelson,
I buried them for you.

06:53.336 --> 06:54.963
Now, that's why
I'm callin' this shot.

06:55.046 --> 06:56.673
She's out.

06:56.756 --> 06:59.509
Not just
until after the election.

07:00.468 --> 07:02.637
You're gonna be
a happily married senator.

07:03.221 --> 07:05.390
Linda's out.
Period.

07:09.769 --> 07:12.647
You don't leave me
any choice, as usual.

07:15.733 --> 07:17.360
Let me call her.

07:32.584 --> 07:34.836
Linda, it's me.

07:35.462 --> 07:37.338
Honey, I've got to see you.

07:37.797 --> 07:39.674
No, not here.
At your place.

07:41.426 --> 07:43.970
Um, give me
about 30 minutes.

07:44.053 --> 07:45.054
Bye.

07:46.806 --> 07:48.183
For God's sake,
Nels,

07:48.266 --> 07:50.393
are you gonna take
a police escort to her place?

07:50.477 --> 07:52.353
You want headlines
of my wife's secretary

07:52.437 --> 07:54.230
taking an overdose
of sleeping pills?

07:54.314 --> 07:57.150
Now let me break it to her
gently, personally.

07:57.901 --> 08:00.320
But what about
that cop out there?

08:06.326 --> 08:07.619
Oh, Sergeant.

08:07.786 --> 08:08.912
Yes, sir.

08:08.953 --> 08:10.246
Sergeant, uh, I wonder

08:10.288 --> 08:11.831
if I can speak with you
for a minute.

08:11.915 --> 08:12.916
Yes, sir.

08:12.957 --> 08:14.417
Uh, not many people
know this,

08:14.459 --> 08:15.460
but I smoke cigars.

08:15.585 --> 08:17.128
Now this may sound
trivial to you,

08:17.212 --> 08:19.129
but unfortunately
cigars are rather bad

08:19.213 --> 08:21.006
for the political image,
so to speak.

08:21.090 --> 08:23.175
The old
smoke-filled room cliche.

08:23.425 --> 08:25.886
Anyway, uh, there are
invariably reporters

08:25.969 --> 08:27.721
in the lobby
of this place.

08:27.805 --> 08:29.598
So I was wondering
if maybe you could, uh,

08:29.681 --> 08:31.100
go down to
the cigar counter

08:31.141 --> 08:32.810
and pick me up
a box of Panatellas?

08:32.893 --> 08:34.436
Oh, no problem.

08:34.603 --> 08:36.897
Except, Mr. Hayward, I... l
really shouldn't be leaving

08:36.980 --> 08:38.023
your room unguarded.

08:38.107 --> 08:39.483
Oh, I think
Mr. Stone and I

08:39.566 --> 08:41.610
can fight them off together
for a few minutes.

08:42.194 --> 08:43.278
Yes, sir.

08:45.781 --> 08:47.199
Is he the only one?

08:47.282 --> 08:49.201
No, there's a couple
more down in the garage.

08:49.284 --> 08:50.285
Harry, give me
your jacket.

08:50.369 --> 08:51.328
What?

08:51.370 --> 08:53.580
Harry, this is
very important to me.

08:53.664 --> 08:55.124
Nels,
this is crazy.

08:55.165 --> 08:57.126
Please, you've had
everything your way.

08:57.167 --> 08:58.460
Just let me have
this much.

08:58.502 --> 09:00.003
Give me your jacket.

09:11.598 --> 09:13.475
Get in the car,
drive right out of here.

09:13.517 --> 09:14.935
Drop the car off
the beach house

09:15.018 --> 09:16.478
and call yourself a cab.

09:25.863 --> 09:27.489
Mr. Hayward, sir!

09:27.531 --> 09:30.033
Mr. Hayward.
Hayward, sir!

12:10.151 --> 12:12.070
Dd

12:13.529 --> 12:14.696
Juanita!

12:18.283 --> 12:19.284
Juanita!

12:41.139 --> 12:42.557
Juanita?

13:00.283 --> 13:01.368
Juanita?

13:07.999 --> 13:09.918
Surprise!
Happy birthday.

13:11.545 --> 13:14.214
Oh, no, you didn't.

13:14.256 --> 13:15.382
Oh, no!

13:15.465 --> 13:17.217
Happy birthday!

13:29.312 --> 13:31.690
Yes, and wearing my hat,
and my jacket,

13:31.773 --> 13:33.900
zipping out of
the garage in my car.

13:34.317 --> 13:35.986
For all I know,
they're still following

13:36.069 --> 13:37.446
old Harry
all over the streets.

13:37.529 --> 13:38.488
I love it.

13:38.572 --> 13:39.573
Now there's a switch.

13:39.656 --> 13:41.366
Imagine a husband
going through all that

13:41.450 --> 13:42.576
just to be
with his wife.

13:42.617 --> 13:43.702
That's a switch.

13:43.785 --> 13:45.829
Well, you run for
office someday

13:45.912 --> 13:47.622
and you'll see
how much privacy you get.

13:47.706 --> 13:49.416
Honey. No, darling,
here, right this way.

13:49.458 --> 13:50.751
Not on
Vicki's birthday.

13:51.460 --> 13:53.503
We are having no press,

13:53.587 --> 13:55.756
no police,
not even outside the house.

13:55.839 --> 13:57.257
Thank you very much.

13:57.299 --> 13:59.760
All right,
there you are, my dear.

14:02.637 --> 14:04.264
And as for you,
my dear friends,

14:04.347 --> 14:05.432
I can promise all of you

14:05.474 --> 14:06.892
that at
the propitious moment,

14:06.975 --> 14:08.852
we shall throw
the entire pack of you

14:08.935 --> 14:10.812
right out of here,
with the utmost courtesy.

14:10.896 --> 14:12.646
And because you're our
dear friends,

14:12.730 --> 14:14.273
and in honor
of the occasion,

14:14.315 --> 14:16.108
will you excuse me
just a moment.

14:16.150 --> 14:18.444
Oh, he's going to
get your gift.

14:35.294 --> 14:37.129
Police Department.

14:37.213 --> 14:40.216
Just wanted to let you know
we keep our promises.

14:40.299 --> 14:42.468
You're worried
about Nelson Hayward?

14:42.927 --> 14:44.595
You'll find
what's left of him

14:44.678 --> 14:46.806
in the garage
of his beach house.

15:06.033 --> 15:07.326
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:07.368 --> 15:10.830
for after dinner,
brandy, 1893.

15:12.081 --> 15:13.207
I was saving this

15:13.332 --> 15:14.834
to toast my election
to the Senate.

15:14.875 --> 15:16.752
But I'm afraid not even
that could bring me

15:16.836 --> 15:18.754
as much pleasure as
I'm having this evening.

15:19.171 --> 15:22.341
To Victoria,
happy birthday, honey.

15:23.092 --> 15:25.386
Dd

15:27.430 --> 15:29.598
You're ltalian, Lieutenant.

15:29.765 --> 15:31.267
I'm ltalian.

15:31.392 --> 15:34.979
Cavelli is ltalian.
You're a cop.

15:35.980 --> 15:38.899
I'm a dentist.
Cavelli's a tenor.

15:39.608 --> 15:41.736
None of us is Mafia.

15:42.194 --> 15:44.321
You know any ltalians
that are Mafia?

15:45.531 --> 15:47.700
Any ltalians
in your family Mafia?

15:48.617 --> 15:50.661
Any ltalians on
the police force Mafia?

15:52.371 --> 15:54.331
Ah, when people talk
about the ltalians,

15:54.415 --> 15:58.419
do they think cops,
dentists, tenors?

15:58.753 --> 16:00.129
The Pope, not even?

16:00.212 --> 16:02.465
The Pope is ltalian,
ain't he?

16:04.884 --> 16:05.843
They think...

16:06.761 --> 16:09.221
They think Mafiosa.

16:09.263 --> 16:11.389
Mafiosa, Mafiosa.

16:14.350 --> 16:16.895
Rinse.
Did I gag you?

16:19.773 --> 16:23.234
A little bit.
Thanks, Doc.

16:23.485 --> 16:24.569
It's okay.

16:24.652 --> 16:25.737
All right.

16:29.324 --> 16:30.617
Here are the x-rays.

16:30.700 --> 16:31.701
Hmm.

16:34.037 --> 16:36.331
The x-rays. What?

16:36.873 --> 16:38.750
That's too bad.

16:38.792 --> 16:40.043
What's too bad?

16:40.168 --> 16:41.419
What do you mean,
"too bad"?

16:42.378 --> 16:45.256
You mean two bad, T-W-O,
or too bad, T-O-O.

16:45.298 --> 16:46.591
What are you saying?

16:46.674 --> 16:48.802
No. I don't know
what you're saying,

16:48.885 --> 16:50.095
"two" or "too"?

16:50.136 --> 16:52.639
When you say too bad,
you mean too bad like

16:52.722 --> 16:54.099
too bad it's a rainy day

16:54.140 --> 16:56.309
or too bad that
there are two that are bad?

16:56.768 --> 16:57.769
It's too bad,

16:57.852 --> 16:59.312
the wisdom tooth's
gotta come out

16:59.396 --> 17:02.107
and the molar we can save
with a temporary.

17:02.482 --> 17:04.442
Dd

17:10.657 --> 17:12.659
We interrupt
Operatic Interludes

17:12.742 --> 17:14.077
for a special news bulletin.

17:14.160 --> 17:16.121
We have just received
an unconfirmed report

17:16.162 --> 17:17.205
that Nelson Hayward,

17:17.288 --> 17:19.499
candidate for United States
Senator from California,

17:19.582 --> 17:21.126
has just been shot and killed.

17:21.209 --> 17:22.961
I got to hear this.

17:23.211 --> 17:25.672
It is understood that
Hayward eluded a police escort

17:25.755 --> 17:27.090
that had been assigned to him

17:27.173 --> 17:29.134
after numerous recent
threats on his life.

17:29.217 --> 17:31.970
No arrests have been made yet,
but we'll keep you advised

17:32.053 --> 17:34.013
as reports reach our newsroom.

17:34.389 --> 17:36.015
Nelson Hayward?

17:36.099 --> 17:37.851
They'll try to
pin it on the Mafia.

17:38.518 --> 17:40.645
Don't let them
do it, Lieutenant.

17:40.687 --> 17:43.064
I just saw this man
a little while ago.

17:43.148 --> 17:45.358
I got to call my wife,
I got to get out of here.

17:45.442 --> 17:47.861
You can't leave without
a temporary in that molar.

17:47.944 --> 17:50.029
All right, Doc,
but make it fast.

17:50.864 --> 17:52.365
Nelson Hayward.

17:53.241 --> 17:55.702
I'll tell you
something else, Lieutenant.

17:56.536 --> 17:58.288
You are an ltalian cop.

17:58.747 --> 18:01.124
No matter who you
catch for that murder,

18:01.249 --> 18:03.668
they're still gonna
say it's the Mafia.

18:04.127 --> 18:05.587
And that you're
covering for them.

18:06.755 --> 18:08.255
Open wide.

18:08.881 --> 18:11.008
Take my advice, Lieutenant,

18:11.467 --> 18:12.760
change your name.

18:14.011 --> 18:16.513
And don't bite down
on anything hard.

18:23.896 --> 18:27.733
Female,
45 years, 5'11", 90 pounds.

18:36.241 --> 18:38.327
2000, South Alameda.

18:38.410 --> 18:41.246
6482, stand by,
information incomplete.

18:50.881 --> 18:52.466
Give me a match?

18:55.219 --> 18:58.263
Murder's always depressing,
but you get over it.

18:58.931 --> 19:00.682
Candidate
for the U.S. Senate.

19:01.016 --> 19:02.810
Here you are,
Lieutenant.

19:03.102 --> 19:04.937
It doesn't make any
difference what party,

19:05.020 --> 19:06.230
black or white...

19:08.107 --> 19:10.150
Knocks the wind
out of you.

19:20.119 --> 19:21.745
Something I can do
for you, Lieutenant?

19:21.912 --> 19:23.580
No, just...

19:23.789 --> 19:25.249
See, the streetlight
is broken.

19:25.374 --> 19:26.834
I bet the kids
did that.

19:27.292 --> 19:29.253
I remember that's
what we used to do.

19:29.420 --> 19:31.422
Throw rocks and
break the streetlight.

19:34.716 --> 19:36.260
Besides the items
I mentioned before,

19:36.301 --> 19:37.636
there were his wallet,

19:37.719 --> 19:39.388
pen, keys,
pack of gum and a hanky.

19:39.471 --> 19:41.265
Now these items were
in his pants pocket.

19:41.306 --> 19:42.307
Good evening.

19:42.349 --> 19:43.517
You're late, Lieutenant.

19:43.642 --> 19:44.810
In Hayward's pockets,

19:44.893 --> 19:46.770
that's in his
camel hair coat pocket,

19:46.812 --> 19:48.814
there was also
a pack of gum, same brand,

19:48.897 --> 19:49.982
and a handkerchief.

19:50.149 --> 19:51.275
But that's
understandable.

19:51.316 --> 19:53.610
Because what were in the pants
belong to the guy,

19:53.694 --> 19:55.529
and what were in
the coat were Hayward's.

19:55.612 --> 19:56.780
That's all we found.

19:56.822 --> 19:57.948
All right.

19:58.157 --> 20:00.951
Lt. Columbo, stay here.
I want to talk to you.

20:00.993 --> 20:02.286
Yes, sir.
Charlie?

20:02.369 --> 20:03.662
Charlie, what's
the Coroner say?

20:03.746 --> 20:04.955
What was he
talking about?

20:05.038 --> 20:06.038
Who?

20:06.122 --> 20:07.665
That detective
who was just here.

20:08.374 --> 20:09.834
I don't know.
I wasn't listening.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.919
Attributed to
three gunshot wounds

20:12.003 --> 20:13.421
two of which
slugs appear

20:13.504 --> 20:14.922
still lodged in
the upper abdomen...

20:15.006 --> 20:16.340
Excuse me,
I'll be right back.

20:16.424 --> 20:18.384
With the third
having passed through

20:18.468 --> 20:19.635
the left cranial area.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.053
Anybody hear
the gunshots?

20:21.137 --> 20:23.306
No. Our men are canvassing
the neighborhood, sir.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.308
There's no luck so far.

20:27.518 --> 20:29.145
Listen,

20:29.228 --> 20:31.439
w-w-what did you mean
over there before

20:31.522 --> 20:33.024
when you said about

20:33.107 --> 20:35.068
it was understandable
about the stuff

20:35.151 --> 20:37.070
being in Hayward's
coat and pants?

20:37.153 --> 20:38.863
I never mentioned
Hayward's pants.

20:38.946 --> 20:40.823
The wallet and key
were in Stone's pants.

20:40.907 --> 20:41.991
Who's Stone?

20:42.033 --> 20:42.992
You're kidding me.

20:43.034 --> 20:44.118
No.

20:44.202 --> 20:45.536
Stone is the victim.

20:46.370 --> 20:47.830
Not Hayward?

20:47.955 --> 20:49.373
Oh, no, Lieutenant.

20:49.457 --> 20:51.250
That's what we
originally thought until...

20:51.334 --> 20:52.960
It's not Hayward?

20:53.711 --> 20:57.715
Oh, boy.
What a relief.

20:58.549 --> 21:00.343
Holy Christmas.

21:01.344 --> 21:03.805
I just found out
it wasn't Hayward.

21:04.138 --> 21:06.057
I already called my wife
to break the news.

21:06.099 --> 21:07.350
She loves Hayward.

21:07.392 --> 21:09.018
I didn't want her
to hear it on TV.

21:09.102 --> 21:10.686
You better
call her back.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.397
Thank goodness
she wasn't home.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.065
Who's Stone?

21:14.148 --> 21:15.775
Stone is
the campaign manager.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.527
A case of
mistaken identity.

21:28.037 --> 21:29.997
Have we got any fingerprints?

21:30.081 --> 21:32.083
The boys are still
dusting the garage,

21:32.125 --> 21:34.085
but they haven't come
up with anything yet.

21:34.127 --> 21:35.753
Anybody see
anything unusual?

21:35.837 --> 21:37.130
No, sir. No one.

21:37.463 --> 21:38.714
Have we been
able to establish

21:38.798 --> 21:40.299
an exact time
of the death?

21:40.383 --> 21:41.968
That looks like
9:20 p.m.

21:42.051 --> 21:43.094
The broken watch

21:43.177 --> 21:45.221
on the wrist of the deceased
would fix the time.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.514
The Coroner
confirmed that?

21:46.597 --> 21:48.725
No he hasn't confirmed, but
he feels that's about right.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.893
He'll give us a full confirmation
before noon tomorrow.

21:50.977 --> 21:53.104
No, no, tell him tomorrow
morning is not good enough.

21:53.187 --> 21:54.605
Tell him I want it tonight.

21:54.689 --> 21:56.399
Now I may want to make
an official report

21:56.566 --> 21:58.276
to the press tomorrow.
So I want it...

21:58.359 --> 21:59.610
What time
do you have?

21:59.694 --> 22:00.737
10:00.

22:01.195 --> 22:02.613
That's what I got.

22:03.947 --> 22:05.782
I want to
get this for sure. Huh?

22:07.242 --> 22:09.161
Excuse me,
I'll be right back.

22:09.953 --> 22:11.538
Before I forget...

22:11.663 --> 22:13.248
Where is he
going this time?

22:31.266 --> 22:32.559
Can I see that?

22:39.066 --> 22:41.443
Lieutenant,
I want you to hear this.

22:49.076 --> 22:51.495
There's no question,
the killer was waiting

22:51.536 --> 22:53.288
right outside
the hotel garage.

22:53.330 --> 22:55.707
When he saw Stone drive off
in Hayward's car here,

22:55.791 --> 22:57.250
there was no security around,

22:57.334 --> 22:58.960
so he took advantage
of the situation.

22:59.044 --> 23:00.754
He followed him
here and he killed him.

23:00.837 --> 23:02.339
That must've
been what happened, sir,

23:02.422 --> 23:03.924
because I tried
to follow the car.

23:04.007 --> 23:05.634
Well, I lost it very
soon afterwards,

23:05.675 --> 23:06.927
at the three-way
intersection.

23:07.010 --> 23:08.720
I took Sunset,
thinking he might be goin'

23:08.804 --> 23:10.013
to his house,
but I was wrong.

23:10.097 --> 23:11.431
That had to be it, sir,

23:11.515 --> 23:13.350
'cause that was
the first time that Hayward

23:13.433 --> 23:15.143
or somebody who
appeared to be Hayward,

23:15.227 --> 23:16.395
was out of our sight.

23:16.478 --> 23:18.855
The first and only time
and what happens?

23:18.939 --> 23:20.273
He winds up dead.

23:20.357 --> 23:22.401
Does anybody have any idea...

23:22.484 --> 23:24.194
Who was the first
guy on the scene?

23:25.195 --> 23:26.488
Uh, Miller.

23:26.613 --> 23:28.615
We haven't been able
to locate him yet.

23:28.698 --> 23:31.326
How much does the press know
about it so far?

23:31.410 --> 23:33.328
Just that Stone's dead,
that's all.

23:33.370 --> 23:35.330
Excuse me, sir,
I'll be right back.

23:39.918 --> 23:40.877
Miller?

23:40.919 --> 23:41.878
Yes.

23:42.671 --> 23:44.589
Miller? You were
the first guy on the scene?

23:44.673 --> 23:45.882
Right.

23:46.049 --> 23:47.259
Was the light on?

23:47.342 --> 23:48.385
No.

23:50.053 --> 23:51.847
Where is
the light switch?

23:51.972 --> 23:53.765
I don't know,
I'm sorry.

24:05.943 --> 24:08.904
I want all of you in my office
tomorrow morning.

24:23.210 --> 24:25.087
Okay, Vernon,
let's hear your version.

24:25.171 --> 24:27.715
Lieutenant,
I want you to hear this.

24:29.592 --> 24:31.761
They couldn't be sure
what exit he used

24:31.844 --> 24:32.887
if he did leave.

24:32.928 --> 24:34.597
After all,
what if he went out

24:34.680 --> 24:36.474
through the main lobby
and not the garage?

24:36.557 --> 24:38.601
I don't care if they've
all left and gone home.

24:38.684 --> 24:40.061
Wake them up if necessary.

24:40.102 --> 24:42.021
Tell him
I'll be right back.

24:42.104 --> 24:44.356
Hey, hey, hold it!

24:44.940 --> 24:47.151
Hey! Hey!

24:48.944 --> 24:49.904
Hold!

24:58.871 --> 25:00.581
Just want to check something,
one minute.

25:00.664 --> 25:02.374
This guy's watch...

25:03.125 --> 25:05.127
I just want to check...

25:05.836 --> 25:07.838
Shirt.

25:16.013 --> 25:17.181
Suit.

25:21.102 --> 25:22.186
Shoes.

25:22.269 --> 25:24.605
Lieutenant!
Where the hell is he?

25:24.814 --> 25:26.607
Coming, sir!

25:29.652 --> 25:30.778
Okay.

25:39.829 --> 25:40.830
Sorry.

25:42.039 --> 25:43.833
You keep disappearing.
Where were you?

25:43.999 --> 25:45.793
Would you send
my car, please?

25:46.585 --> 25:49.672
Lieutenant, look,

25:49.880 --> 25:51.465
if it was Hayward
that was killed,

25:51.507 --> 25:53.342
naturally, I'd head up
this investigation.

25:53.717 --> 25:54.969
But it wasn't,
it was Stone.

25:55.052 --> 25:56.554
So right now,
I'm more concerned

25:56.637 --> 25:57.888
with Hayward's future,

25:57.972 --> 25:59.472
that nothing happens to him.

25:59.556 --> 26:01.516
So I'm going to concentrate
on his security.

26:01.599 --> 26:03.810
It will be your job
to locate this lunatic,

26:03.852 --> 26:04.894
whoever he is.

26:04.978 --> 26:05.895
Yes, sir.

26:07.021 --> 26:08.273
Is that my car?

26:17.949 --> 26:20.034
Lieutenant.
Lt. Columbo.

26:21.161 --> 26:23.830
We've finally located
Hayward, he's at home.

26:24.372 --> 26:26.583
It took a long time
to locate him at home?

26:26.666 --> 26:28.960
Yes, sir.
Well, we called earlier,

26:29.043 --> 26:31.004
but the maid kept
insisting he wasn't there.

26:31.087 --> 26:33.131
But I just called
and got a hold of his wife.

26:33.214 --> 26:34.424
He's there,
all right.

26:34.507 --> 26:35.717
There's
some kind of a party.

26:35.884 --> 26:37.093
Do they know about this?

26:37.177 --> 26:38.762
Oh, no, sir,
I figured that

26:38.845 --> 26:40.847
you'd want to make
the official visit.

26:41.097 --> 26:43.433
Yeah. Yeah,
I guess I'd better.

26:44.267 --> 26:45.518
Uh, excuse me, sir.

27:04.204 --> 27:05.163
Excuse me.

27:05.246 --> 27:06.164
Sure.

27:13.379 --> 27:14.923
Yes,
can I help you?

27:15.006 --> 27:17.133
Uh, I'm Lt. Columbo, ma'am.
Police.

27:17.217 --> 27:19.010
I'd like to speak
to Mr. Hayward.

27:19.094 --> 27:21.262
Oh, no need
for concern.

27:21.346 --> 27:22.722
He's perfectly safe.
Thank you.

27:22.806 --> 27:24.557
Yes, ma'am,
I... I know.

27:24.599 --> 27:25.934
Uh, but I'd like
to speak to him.

27:26.017 --> 27:27.268
This is important.
I'd like to...

27:27.352 --> 27:28.728
I know it's important,

27:28.812 --> 27:30.397
but we're having
a private party.

27:30.438 --> 27:31.940
It's my birthday.

27:32.690 --> 27:34.609
So why don't you
just go round the back

27:34.692 --> 27:36.111
and get yourself
a piece of cake?

27:36.194 --> 27:37.612
The maid'll fix
you a cup of coffee

27:37.695 --> 27:38.738
and a piece of cake.

27:38.780 --> 27:39.823
Thank you
very much, ma'am.

27:39.906 --> 27:41.032
I appreciate that.
But...

27:41.116 --> 27:42.367
Don't be so serious.

27:42.450 --> 27:43.535
Go have
a piece of cake.

27:43.618 --> 27:44.619
Really, it's delicious.

27:44.702 --> 27:46.621
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

27:46.663 --> 27:47.914
Yes?

27:47.956 --> 27:49.416
It can't wait.

27:51.292 --> 27:53.336
All right,
if it can't wait.

27:54.921 --> 27:56.297
What's your name?

27:56.464 --> 27:57.840
Columbo.

27:57.923 --> 27:59.216
Lt. Columbo.

28:08.934 --> 28:10.894
I know.
Usually, I get this.

28:10.978 --> 28:13.939
Excuse us. This is
Lt. Columbo, the police.

28:13.981 --> 28:15.107
Well?

28:15.149 --> 28:16.150
Couldn't wait.

28:16.233 --> 28:18.777
Lieutenant,
trapped me in my lair, eh?

28:18.986 --> 28:20.779
I'm sorry
to disturb your party.

28:20.863 --> 28:23.490
Oh, no, no, no, it's I
who should apologize to you.

28:23.574 --> 28:26.410
After all, avoiding
your compatriots like that.

28:26.493 --> 28:28.287
I'm sorry,
but it's my wife's birthday,

28:28.328 --> 28:30.330
and I'd planned
this little surprise, you see.

28:30.414 --> 28:31.832
I'll call
the Commissioner's office

28:31.915 --> 28:33.125
in the morning
and apologize

28:33.208 --> 28:35.544
and get those other detectives
off the hook as well.

28:35.627 --> 28:37.045
Why don't you fix
yourself a drink?

28:37.129 --> 28:38.589
Make yourself at home.
Take your coat off.

28:38.839 --> 28:40.424
This, uh,
this security problem

28:40.507 --> 28:42.551
really gets
to be an aggravation.

28:43.677 --> 28:44.803
Excuse me, Mr. Hayward.

28:44.845 --> 28:45.846
Yes?

28:45.929 --> 28:47.890
If I could have
a moment with you privately.

28:47.973 --> 28:49.641
It's rather serious,
I'm afraid.

28:49.683 --> 28:50.976
Oh? It is?

28:51.185 --> 28:52.311
Well, dear, I guess

28:52.352 --> 28:54.521
the old clothing switch
is a felony.

28:54.605 --> 28:56.356
He'll probably
gonna tell us Harry and I

28:56.440 --> 28:58.817
are guilty of aggravated
police avoidance. Eh?

28:58.859 --> 29:00.944
No, sir,
nothing like that.

29:03.906 --> 29:05.365
Excuse me, darling.

29:06.241 --> 29:07.451
I'm from Homicide.

29:07.534 --> 29:08.744
Oh, you're
a little premature.

29:08.827 --> 29:09.995
They haven't got me yet.

29:10.079 --> 29:11.747
Uh, yes, sir,
I know.

29:11.872 --> 29:13.582
And we're mighty
grateful for that.

29:15.375 --> 29:17.377
Uh, but there
has been a homicide.

29:17.711 --> 29:19.296
There has been a homicide?

29:19.379 --> 29:20.589
Yes, sir.

29:21.632 --> 29:23.675
Mr. Stone,
your campaign manager,

29:24.385 --> 29:25.344
he's dead.

29:27.513 --> 29:29.348
Harry Stone is dead?

29:30.557 --> 29:31.517
Vicki.

29:31.600 --> 29:32.810
What? What?

29:32.893 --> 29:34.436
Harry Stone is dead.

29:35.562 --> 29:36.480
Harry.

29:36.563 --> 29:38.023
H-How? How?
Where?

29:38.357 --> 29:40.234
At your beach house,
in the garage. Shot.

29:40.317 --> 29:41.527
Oh, no.

29:41.610 --> 29:42.569
Murdered.

29:42.611 --> 29:43.570
Oh, no.

29:43.612 --> 29:44.822
Oh, it's impossible.

29:44.905 --> 29:45.989
Honey.

29:47.074 --> 29:49.118
I don't believe it.

29:49.243 --> 29:51.328
It's all right, sweetheart.
I can't believe it.

29:51.578 --> 29:53.872
We just... just saw him,
just this afternoon.

29:54.748 --> 29:57.500
Under the circumstances,
I'm sure you understand.

29:57.583 --> 29:58.709
Yes.

29:58.835 --> 30:00.002
We'll just say
good night.

30:00.086 --> 30:01.337
Of course.

30:01.421 --> 30:03.047
I want to thank
you all for coming.

30:03.131 --> 30:04.382
I really appreciate it.

30:04.465 --> 30:06.175
So sweet of you
to bring the gifts.

30:08.594 --> 30:10.096
He was wearing
some of your clothes,

30:10.179 --> 30:11.264
driving your car.

30:11.347 --> 30:12.849
Probably somebody
thought it was you,

30:12.932 --> 30:14.392
and shot him.

30:15.184 --> 30:18.688
I pull a sophomoric prank
and poor Harry is...

30:20.606 --> 30:22.734
Did you know,
sir, that he was going out

30:22.817 --> 30:24.235
to your beach house?

30:24.277 --> 30:27.321
Yes. I told him
to spend the night there.

30:29.490 --> 30:30.742
All I can say, sir,

30:30.825 --> 30:32.744
is whoever did it,
we'll get 'em.

30:34.787 --> 30:38.416
He wasn't just
a campaign manager, he was

30:38.458 --> 30:41.252
a... a very close
personal friend!

30:42.545 --> 30:44.172
There was
a threat on his life.

30:44.255 --> 30:46.090
It was on
the early news today.

30:46.466 --> 30:48.259
I don't know
whether this is the time,

30:48.426 --> 30:50.219
but for the purpose
of my report,

30:50.303 --> 30:51.679
uh, I'd like to ask you...

30:51.804 --> 30:53.806
Oh, leave me alone.
Please, leave me alone.

30:58.811 --> 31:00.688
Good night.

31:01.981 --> 31:02.940
Good night.

31:03.066 --> 31:04.025
Goodbye, dear.

31:04.108 --> 31:05.485
We'll be near
if you need us.

31:05.651 --> 31:07.028
Call us, will you?
I will.

31:07.111 --> 31:08.780
I'll call you tomorrow,
darling.

31:08.821 --> 31:10.823
If there's anything
we can do for you,

31:10.865 --> 31:12.033
anything at all...

31:12.116 --> 31:13.076
Excuse me, sir.

31:13.159 --> 31:14.118
Just call us.

31:14.160 --> 31:15.411
Okay.

31:15.495 --> 31:17.872
Uh, I, uh...

31:17.955 --> 31:20.583
Just for the purposes
of my report, uh,

31:21.084 --> 31:22.126
could you tell me

31:22.210 --> 31:23.503
what time
the party started?

31:24.837 --> 31:26.130
It was...
I don't know.

31:26.297 --> 31:29.759
Nels told us all to all be
there at 8:30 at the back,

31:29.842 --> 31:31.969
so we could come in with him
when he came home.

31:32.053 --> 31:33.137
The surprise bit.

31:33.221 --> 31:34.680
Yes, it was
around 8:30.

31:34.764 --> 31:36.641
At 8:30 he came,
and we all came in.

31:36.682 --> 31:38.059
That's all.

31:38.684 --> 31:41.020
Good night, Lucy.
Good night, George.

31:41.854 --> 31:43.147
Uh, Ma'am, uh...

31:44.399 --> 31:47.151
You know, whoever, uh,
made this threat

31:47.235 --> 31:49.112
on your husband's
life is gonna know

31:49.195 --> 31:50.988
that he didn't make
good on that threat.

31:51.030 --> 31:53.407
So we're gonna have a man
posted out here tonight,

31:53.490 --> 31:55.826
just... just to do everything
possible, uh, to, uh...

31:56.535 --> 31:58.370
Okay. Good.

31:58.787 --> 32:00.455
Sir, uh, your pen.

32:11.633 --> 32:12.634
Oh!

32:12.759 --> 32:14.886
Don't tell me
a little thing

32:14.970 --> 32:16.680
like Harry's
getting murdered

32:16.722 --> 32:19.558
is enough to make you
sleep at home tonight.

32:20.851 --> 32:22.185
No, I forgot.

32:22.894 --> 32:24.813
Police guard outside.

32:24.938 --> 32:26.898
Can't step out tonight,
can you?

32:30.944 --> 32:32.696
Vicki, let's don't go
at each other again.

32:32.779 --> 32:34.656
Not tonight.
No.

32:34.740 --> 32:35.782
Come on.

32:35.866 --> 32:37.284
Let's not.

32:37.868 --> 32:39.411
Out of respect

32:40.078 --> 32:41.705
for poor, dead Harry.

32:43.749 --> 32:45.917
Besides, I wouldn't
want to see you

32:46.001 --> 32:48.128
dissemble before
my very eyes again.

32:50.047 --> 32:53.759
Your display of grief
is overpowering.

32:55.177 --> 32:56.303
In spite of everything,

32:56.386 --> 32:58.555
the man had been
with me a long time.

33:00.098 --> 33:01.099
True.

33:02.476 --> 33:04.227
Come on,
let's go to bed.

33:06.897 --> 33:08.607
Is that invitation
social,

33:09.775 --> 33:11.693
or just
a professional courtesy?

33:14.071 --> 33:16.198
I wish you
wouldn't drink so much.

33:17.240 --> 33:18.700
It's what I do best.

33:20.368 --> 33:22.370
Besides,
it's something that

33:22.996 --> 33:25.874
you don't need
a steady partner, after all.

33:27.417 --> 33:28.794
Come on, Vicki,
it's getting late.

33:28.877 --> 33:30.128
Now
we're going to bed.

33:30.212 --> 33:31.963
Sometimes
you frighten me.

33:32.047 --> 33:33.924
What are you
talking about?

33:34.007 --> 33:35.050
That act you put on.

33:35.133 --> 33:36.093
Act?

33:36.134 --> 33:38.178
Mmm-hmm. When you heard
about Harry's being dead.

33:38.261 --> 33:39.763
I was shocked!

33:40.472 --> 33:42.432
That's what
frightens me.

33:43.308 --> 33:44.768
You were
so convincing.

33:44.810 --> 33:47.813
I know
how you despised him.

33:48.438 --> 33:50.107
Well, it's
the political game

33:50.190 --> 33:52.274
I've been playing
for so many years, too, Vicki.

33:52.358 --> 33:53.943
After a while
you react the way

33:53.984 --> 33:56.195
people expect you to,
not as you really feel.

33:56.278 --> 33:57.238
That's true.

33:57.321 --> 33:59.073
Maybe I was feeling
a little for myself.

33:59.156 --> 34:01.283
I mean that bullet
was meant for me.

34:06.122 --> 34:08.499
I'm sorry, of course.
It's just that sometimes

34:08.582 --> 34:11.085
I feel like you're
playing that game with me.

34:13.129 --> 34:14.338
I tell you.

34:14.422 --> 34:17.299
What if I filed
for divorce now?

34:18.134 --> 34:19.719
Before the election.

34:19.802 --> 34:21.762
That'd sober us both
pretty good, wouldn't it?

34:21.846 --> 34:23.973
Wait a minute, Vicki, listen to me.
Listen to me.

34:24.014 --> 34:25.766
I want you to believe
I'm sorry

34:25.850 --> 34:27.560
for the things
that have come between us.

34:27.643 --> 34:29.353
There is no other woman
in my life,

34:29.437 --> 34:31.147
but, yes, I do want
to be Senator.

34:31.230 --> 34:33.816
But never did I
ever want to lose you.

34:34.316 --> 34:35.985
I never wanted that.

34:36.485 --> 34:38.154
I wish you could
believe me.

34:41.907 --> 34:43.075
Oh, honey.

34:45.035 --> 34:48.164
Oh, Nels. Oh, baby.

34:48.205 --> 34:49.165
Oh.

34:49.498 --> 34:50.916
Hey. I know what.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.627
I've got a three-day
whistle-stop tour coming up.

34:53.711 --> 34:54.837
Why don't you
come with me?

34:54.920 --> 34:56.714
We'll campaign together,
like old times.

34:58.299 --> 34:59.383
I can't.
Yes.

34:59.467 --> 35:00.468
I hate all those crowds.

35:00.551 --> 35:02.678
No, you don't and they
love you, come on.

35:02.720 --> 35:03.846
I do.
Come on.

35:03.888 --> 35:05.765
Oh, listen, and then
I'll have to stay alone

35:05.848 --> 35:06.891
all the time
in the hotel.

35:06.974 --> 35:08.350
I won't be
leaving you alone much.

35:08.434 --> 35:09.351
Come on.

35:09.435 --> 35:10.644
You work
all the time...

35:10.728 --> 35:12.688
No, no. Take... take that
appointments secretary

35:12.772 --> 35:13.939
Harry got you.
What's her name?

35:14.023 --> 35:14.982
Linda?

35:15.066 --> 35:16.609
Yes, bring her along.

35:57.107 --> 35:59.442
Good to see you.
Thank you. Thank you.

35:59.526 --> 36:01.444
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

36:01.528 --> 36:02.612
Terrific. Terrific.

36:02.695 --> 36:04.406
You're wonderful,
wonderful, all of you!

36:04.447 --> 36:05.949
Thank you so very much.
Thank you.

36:05.990 --> 36:07.700
Sergeant,
I'd like you to be sure

36:07.784 --> 36:09.077
my little lady
gets home safely

36:09.160 --> 36:10.954
and all that luggage
out in the limousine.

36:11.037 --> 36:12.539
We'll take care of it, sir.

36:12.622 --> 36:14.124
Thank you. Uh, Linda,
Miss Johnson.

36:14.165 --> 36:15.417
You got a copy
of my itinerary?

36:15.500 --> 36:17.085
You better pick one up,
right away.

36:17.168 --> 36:18.795
Goodbye, darling,
I'll see you home.

36:18.878 --> 36:20.380
Bye.

36:20.505 --> 36:22.006
Goodbye, sweetie. Thank you.

36:22.090 --> 36:23.591
Thank you again,
very much.

36:23.758 --> 36:25.260
Thank you, bye. Yes?

36:25.343 --> 36:27.846
Sure, sure. Yes.
How are you? How are you?

36:29.222 --> 36:31.099
Yes, how are you?
Glad to see you.

36:31.224 --> 36:33.351
Thank you again so much,
so much, you really...

36:33.435 --> 36:36.062
Just... just thank you, I can't
tell you, it's just terrific.

36:36.146 --> 36:38.732
Oh, thank you.
All right there, all right.

36:38.815 --> 36:39.858
Thank you very much.

36:39.941 --> 36:42.819
Thank you so very much.
See you later.

36:42.902 --> 36:44.779
We're gonna win it.

36:44.946 --> 36:46.823
Hey, Lieutenant,
glad to see you.

36:46.906 --> 36:49.951
Mr. Hayward. Saw the latest
poll and you're doing terrific.

36:50.034 --> 36:51.453
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

36:51.494 --> 36:53.121
You are voting in
this one, aren't you?

36:53.204 --> 36:55.039
Oh, I vote. Every election,
I vote.

36:55.123 --> 36:56.416
In our house,
you gotta vote.

36:56.499 --> 36:57.792
Very sacred thing.

36:57.876 --> 36:59.335
We sit around
the kitchen table

36:59.377 --> 37:00.503
and we discuss.
And we vote.

37:00.587 --> 37:02.172
Uh-huh.
Then you've made up your mind

37:02.255 --> 37:03.882
about the candidates
in this election.

37:03.965 --> 37:05.258
Don't worry
about my wife, sir,

37:05.341 --> 37:06.468
she's crazy about you.

37:06.551 --> 37:07.594
And you?

37:07.677 --> 37:10.138
Uh, I'm still a little
bit on the fence,

37:10.180 --> 37:11.431
if you know
what I mean.

37:11.514 --> 37:12.932
We're just going
to have to put you

37:13.016 --> 37:14.476
on the undecided list
I guess.

37:14.559 --> 37:16.603
Oh, did you want to see me
about anything special?

37:16.686 --> 37:18.480
Uh, oh, no, sir,
uh, nothing.

37:18.521 --> 37:20.273
I mean, it can wait.
Whenever you're...

37:20.356 --> 37:22.108
Oh, fine, fine.
Thank you very much.

37:22.192 --> 37:23.610
I'll see you in a bit.

37:25.528 --> 37:27.530
Lieutenant,
you've got something new

37:27.572 --> 37:28.990
on the Stone death?

37:29.574 --> 37:31.868
Uh, no.
Nothing concrete, Sergeant.

37:34.537 --> 37:36.456
You don't have a match,
do you?

37:40.168 --> 37:41.878
Don't be nervous.
The door is locked.

37:41.961 --> 37:43.421
I can't help it.

37:43.505 --> 37:44.839
I've missed you.

37:45.090 --> 37:47.383
It's not easy being
around your wife all the time.

37:47.466 --> 37:49.593
I know, I know it's been
very difficult for you.

37:49.676 --> 37:51.303
It has been
for me, too.

37:52.513 --> 37:53.472
Dd

37:59.728 --> 38:01.980
They're going to wonder
what's going on in here.

38:02.064 --> 38:04.024
I have
a very busy itinerary.

38:04.733 --> 38:05.859
I worry about you.

38:06.026 --> 38:07.152
How's that?

38:07.277 --> 38:08.654
Well, the murder.

38:08.737 --> 38:11.573
Oh, I'm well protected.
I'm overprotected.

38:11.740 --> 38:13.075
I still worry.

38:13.242 --> 38:14.576
That's nice.

38:15.077 --> 38:17.538
You know, Harry was right
about one thing.

38:18.080 --> 38:20.749
I shouldn't see you
until Election Day is over.

38:21.333 --> 38:23.001
And anyway,
it's just a few days.

38:23.085 --> 38:24.044
Uh-huh.

38:27.297 --> 38:28.716
Dd

38:38.600 --> 38:39.685
For Mr. Hayward.

38:39.768 --> 38:40.728
I'll sign for it.

38:40.811 --> 38:42.688
I'm supposed to
deliver it to him in person.

38:42.771 --> 38:44.982
He's in conference,
he may be a while.

38:48.694 --> 38:50.612
I'll take that.
Thank you.

39:14.053 --> 39:15.429
Be right with you,
Lieutenant.

39:15.554 --> 39:16.930
All right, Helen.

39:17.014 --> 39:18.140
What else have got?

39:18.223 --> 39:20.017
Lunch at 12:00
with Judge Forsberg.

39:20.100 --> 39:22.144
The Hadassah tea has been
pushed back to 3:00...

39:22.227 --> 39:24.229
All right, all right,
I'm sorry I asked.

39:24.480 --> 39:25.981
Come on, Lieutenant.
Come on.

39:28.108 --> 39:29.401
What's new
on the murder?

39:29.526 --> 39:30.819
I've been
following the papers.

39:30.903 --> 39:33.113
And I called your Commissioner's
office from Fresno.

39:33.197 --> 39:35.365
But what's
being done, Lieutenant?

39:36.075 --> 39:37.076
Uh...

39:37.326 --> 39:38.952
Sit down, sit down,
please, please.

39:40.454 --> 39:43.332
So far, sir,
we don't have a thing.

39:43.832 --> 39:44.957
Well, that's heartening.

39:45.083 --> 39:46.209
Officially, that is.

39:46.334 --> 39:48.169
And unofficially?

39:48.336 --> 39:50.171
Unofficially we don't
have anything either.

39:51.089 --> 39:52.340
Well, I don't understand...

39:52.423 --> 39:54.133
That is,
the Department doesn't.

39:54.217 --> 39:56.135
Now me, personally,
and believe me, sir,

39:56.177 --> 39:58.096
that is extremely unofficial.

39:58.221 --> 39:59.680
I want you to
understand that.

39:59.764 --> 40:01.474
Would you get to the point,
Lieutenant?

40:01.808 --> 40:02.809
Yes, sir.

40:03.101 --> 40:04.102
Um,

40:09.399 --> 40:11.192
Could I write
on this, sir?

40:13.319 --> 40:14.612
I don't mean
on the picture.

40:14.737 --> 40:16.030
I mean
on the back?

40:16.114 --> 40:17.490
Anything you want.

40:18.950 --> 40:20.660
You got plenty of these?

40:23.579 --> 40:25.832
I just hate to
waste anything.

40:26.249 --> 40:28.084
It's, uh,
a family trait.

40:28.167 --> 40:29.502
Anything you want.

40:29.836 --> 40:32.296
But Lieutenant, please,
just get to the point.

40:32.755 --> 40:34.841
You know, my brother is 38,
and he's still got

40:34.924 --> 40:37.009
his sneakers
from high school, you know.

40:37.301 --> 40:38.302
Um,

40:40.638 --> 40:43.141
this is embarrassing.
The one time I have a pencil

40:43.224 --> 40:45.351
it turns out to be
the wrong kind.

40:45.601 --> 40:47.395
Uh, could I borrow
that marking pen?

40:47.478 --> 40:48.771
Certainly.

40:49.397 --> 40:52.233
Uh, excuse me, Lieutenant,
don't misunderstand.

40:52.316 --> 40:54.235
You're a very nice man.
I like you very much.

40:54.318 --> 40:56.154
But I would hate
to have to depend upon you

40:56.237 --> 40:57.822
if I was in a hurry
for something.

40:57.905 --> 40:59.365
You know,
that's what my wife says...

40:59.449 --> 41:00.867
I'm sure she does.

41:00.950 --> 41:02.285
Get to the point,
Lieutenant.

41:02.368 --> 41:03.411
Right.

41:04.036 --> 41:06.956
Uh, I don't know how
important this all is,

41:07.040 --> 41:10.251
but, uh, but you know,
it's better to get it out.

41:10.460 --> 41:14.297
Uh, this is the, uh, street
in front of your garage.

41:14.380 --> 41:16.049
Here's your garage.

41:16.132 --> 41:18.634
Here's where the body
was found. Now, as I said,

41:18.718 --> 41:20.887
uh, I'm not sure
what it all adds up to,

41:20.928 --> 41:22.764
but, uh, I think
we ought to investigate...

41:22.847 --> 41:24.557
Yes, Lieutenant, just...

41:25.558 --> 41:29.479
Now, uh, according to
the prevailing theory

41:29.604 --> 41:30.938
and believe me, sir,
all the boys

41:31.022 --> 41:33.149
down in the Department,
they're convinced of this.

41:33.232 --> 41:34.192
Of the prevailing theory?

41:34.275 --> 41:35.276
Yes, sir.

41:35.359 --> 41:37.361
That the killer was
waiting outside the hotel,

41:37.445 --> 41:39.655
saw Mr. Stone drive out,

41:39.739 --> 41:41.532
when there was
no security men around,

41:41.616 --> 41:43.325
took advantage of
that opportunity,

41:43.408 --> 41:45.160
to follow him out
to your beach house.

41:45.243 --> 41:46.578
And that's when
he shot him.

41:46.661 --> 41:48.288
Now, uh,

41:48.789 --> 41:51.708
here's the thing that's
been troubling me, sir, uh.

41:52.793 --> 41:54.669
Did you ever throw
rocks at the streetlight

41:54.753 --> 41:55.962
when you were a kid?

41:56.713 --> 41:57.756
Yes.

41:58.215 --> 42:00.592
Well, that must have
been what happened.

42:01.468 --> 42:03.804
See the kids, they broke
this streetlight here.

42:05.764 --> 42:07.057
The kids broke
the streetlight?

42:07.140 --> 42:08.100
Yes.

42:08.183 --> 42:10.977
And, uh, I
just don't see

42:11.061 --> 42:12.813
how the murderer
had enough light

42:13.146 --> 42:15.107
to see
Mr. Stone in the dark,

42:15.315 --> 42:16.775
in order to shoot him.

42:17.818 --> 42:19.486
Well, he could have
used his headlights.

42:19.569 --> 42:21.822
I mean, uh, that is
one answer that makes sense.

42:21.905 --> 42:23.782
First thing
I thought of, sir.

42:23.949 --> 42:26.076
But you see this street,
here, is very narrow.

42:26.159 --> 42:27.536
Twenty-eight feet.

42:27.661 --> 42:28.620
Now, uh,

42:30.747 --> 42:32.457
I went down to
Motor Vehicles,

42:32.541 --> 42:34.167
I got some models down.

42:37.754 --> 42:40.549
I hope I haven't
forgotten them.

42:40.674 --> 42:41.842
Oh, here we are.

42:41.925 --> 42:43.135
Now you see, for me,

42:43.218 --> 42:46.012
when I can see something,
it's clearer in my mind.

42:48.890 --> 42:51.560
This is Mr. Stone
in your car, sir.

42:51.643 --> 42:54.020
Comes up,
pulls into the garage.

42:56.565 --> 42:59.443
Killer follows,
makes a left turn,

42:59.526 --> 43:01.194
to throw his headlights
into the garage.

43:01.278 --> 43:03.488
The problem is,
he's blocking traffic.

43:03.572 --> 43:05.407
I mean, right in
the middle of the shooting

43:05.490 --> 43:07.284
a citizen comes down,
what's he gonna say?

43:07.367 --> 43:09.327
"I'm in the middle
of the shooting, you know."

43:09.411 --> 43:10.829
It's too chancy.

43:11.413 --> 43:13.248
But I mean
hired killers are crazy,

43:13.331 --> 43:15.250
who knows
what they would've done.

43:15.333 --> 43:16.668
It only takes
a couple of seconds

43:16.710 --> 43:17.753
to shoot somebody.

43:17.836 --> 43:19.755
I mean it's not like
he was blocking traffic

43:19.838 --> 43:21.173
for a long time. Huh.

43:21.381 --> 43:23.925
Well, it's not ideal
for a quick getaway, sir.

43:24.259 --> 43:26.428
But, uh, well, maybe.

43:26.720 --> 43:28.305
But I still don't see

43:28.388 --> 43:30.182
how he could've got
any light in there.

43:30.807 --> 43:33.143
You see,
if he pulled up here...

43:33.226 --> 43:35.270
Now, remember,
you got that big car.

43:36.396 --> 43:38.190
His beams would
shine directly

43:38.231 --> 43:39.775
into the trunk
of your car.

43:40.733 --> 43:43.527
So that the spot
where Mr. Stone was shot

43:43.861 --> 43:45.404
would still be
in the dark.

43:48.032 --> 43:50.242
Have you actually
tested this out, Lieutenant?

43:50.326 --> 43:52.578
Oh, yes, sir,
we had actual cars up there.

43:52.661 --> 43:54.121
And you're trying to
tell me

43:54.205 --> 43:56.540
that there's no other angle
in which a second car

43:56.624 --> 43:58.626
could use his headlights
to illuminate the spot

43:58.709 --> 44:00.294
where Harry Stone
was killed?

44:00.378 --> 44:01.837
Yes, sir. Uh, yeah,

44:01.921 --> 44:03.631
there... there
was one other possibility.

44:03.714 --> 44:05.299
You bet your life
there was one.

44:05.383 --> 44:06.759
Here. Excuse me.

44:06.842 --> 44:09.637
If he pulled in like this...
Granted his right headlight

44:09.720 --> 44:11.722
would point directly
into the trunk of my car,

44:11.806 --> 44:13.057
not throw off
any useful light.

44:13.099 --> 44:15.142
But the left headlight
would have a clear path

44:15.226 --> 44:17.395
to illuminate the spot where
Harry Stone was killed.

44:17.478 --> 44:18.813
Now tell me
that's not possible.

44:18.896 --> 44:20.189
Yes, sir,
it is possible.

44:20.272 --> 44:21.690
I mean,
I-it's conceivable.

44:22.024 --> 44:24.318
But that's like catching
lightning in a bottle,

44:24.402 --> 44:27.029
for this car to hit
that exact spot.

44:27.947 --> 44:29.156
But it is possible?

44:29.240 --> 44:30.866
Yes, sir,
it is possible.

44:32.118 --> 44:33.911
Uh, it's possible.

44:36.122 --> 44:37.581
But then
the shots couldn't come

44:37.623 --> 44:39.542
from the right hand
half of the garage.

44:41.627 --> 44:44.755
You see, sir,
according to Ballistics,

44:45.005 --> 44:47.091
the killer was
in this area here.

44:47.341 --> 44:49.593
And the shots came
in this direction.

44:53.097 --> 44:56.058
Now, if the second car hit
the mark that you suggested,

44:56.142 --> 44:58.561
the killer would have to
lean out of the driver's seat

44:58.644 --> 45:00.354
and shoot from here.

45:00.438 --> 45:03.899
The shots would come
in this direction.

45:09.697 --> 45:12.283
See, and that's contrary to
the ballistics report.

45:18.080 --> 45:19.749
Hmm-mmm. hmm-mmm.

45:20.833 --> 45:22.460
Very interesting.

45:24.336 --> 45:25.296
Very interesting.

45:29.341 --> 45:30.634
Hmm-mmm. I see.

45:32.178 --> 45:34.430
You, uh,
you don't think

45:34.513 --> 45:36.640
the murderer followed
Harry out there

45:37.266 --> 45:38.725
and that he was, uh...

45:39.267 --> 45:40.268
Hmm-mmm.

45:41.019 --> 45:42.270
A thought.

45:43.521 --> 45:45.732
Suppose he
didn't follow him.

45:45.815 --> 45:47.817
Suppose he was
already at the beach house,

45:47.901 --> 45:49.652
just waiting.

45:49.944 --> 45:51.571
Waiting for what, sir?

45:51.654 --> 45:52.989
To shoot me, Lieutenant,

45:53.031 --> 45:54.783
to take out a gun
and to shoot me.

45:55.867 --> 45:57.786
With all your
security around?

46:00.163 --> 46:01.498
You see, sir,

46:01.581 --> 46:03.666
if the murderer didn't follow
Mr. Stone out, then

46:03.750 --> 46:04.793
how would he know

46:04.876 --> 46:07.379
that the security men
wouldn't have been there?

46:07.921 --> 46:11.091
It's a good thought,
I didn't think of that.

46:12.384 --> 46:15.053
Well. Well, now, what, uh,

46:15.428 --> 46:17.180
what do you make of
all this, Lieutenant?

46:17.347 --> 46:19.140
Nothing conclusive, sir.

46:20.016 --> 46:22.477
But maybe the prevailing
theory is wrong.

46:23.520 --> 46:26.147
Maybe this is not a case
of mistaken identity.

46:27.524 --> 46:29.150
Maybe the murderer

46:29.234 --> 46:30.693
actually wanted to kill
Mr. Stone...

46:30.735 --> 46:32.862
What're you talking about?
That is absurd.

46:32.904 --> 46:34.739
Repeated threats
are made on my life,

46:34.823 --> 46:36.658
and a man wearing
my jacket and my hat,

46:36.783 --> 46:38.702
driving my car,
pulls into my garage

46:38.785 --> 46:40.036
and he's shot down dead.

46:40.078 --> 46:42.372
And you say that's not a case
of mistaken identity.

46:42.414 --> 46:44.416
I don't believe that.
I just don't believe it.

46:45.375 --> 46:47.043
I thought
you'd be relieved.

46:47.085 --> 46:48.211
But I...

46:48.294 --> 46:50.588
I mean, I mean,

46:50.672 --> 46:52.257
I thought you'd be
happy to know that

46:52.340 --> 46:54.467
the murderer wasn't
trying to shoot you.

46:55.385 --> 46:57.554
Well, Lieutenant, it's... it's
not a case of relief.

46:57.637 --> 46:59.431
It's a... it's a... it's a case

46:59.514 --> 47:01.766
of just trying
to intelligently appraise

47:01.850 --> 47:03.727
exactly what happened.

47:03.768 --> 47:05.770
Absolutely.
Absolutely, sir.

47:06.646 --> 47:08.314
I have to admit
if it was me,

47:08.773 --> 47:10.066
I'd feel relieved.

47:12.485 --> 47:14.988
I think I've taken up
enough of your time.

47:17.157 --> 47:18.158
Oh.

47:18.658 --> 47:19.659
Sorry.

47:20.785 --> 47:22.579
Let me put this back.

47:22.746 --> 47:24.706
I like to leave things
the way I found them.

47:27.625 --> 47:28.918
Your marking pen.

47:33.590 --> 47:34.716
You know,

47:36.009 --> 47:38.010
isn't it funny
the way people react

47:38.093 --> 47:39.845
under the stress
of a situation?

47:41.305 --> 47:43.057
I wasn't talking
about you, sir.

47:43.140 --> 47:45.059
No, I was talking
about Miss Johnson now.

47:46.060 --> 47:47.186
I beg your pardon?

47:47.269 --> 47:48.562
Miss Johnson.

47:48.645 --> 47:50.939
The girl that came in here
to pick up an itinerary.

47:51.023 --> 47:52.483
I happened to
hear that mentioned

47:52.566 --> 47:53.901
when I was sitting out there.

47:53.984 --> 47:56.153
So she came in and now
she walked out without it.

47:56.236 --> 47:58.072
See, here it is, sir.
It's right here

47:58.155 --> 47:59.448
on your desk
with her name on it.

47:59.531 --> 48:01.492
Well, we were making
a number of additions

48:01.575 --> 48:03.327
to the itinerary.
I suppose she forgot it.

48:03.410 --> 48:05.245
You're correct about
one thing, Lieutenant.

48:05.329 --> 48:06.914
These campaigns are
a lot of pressure.

48:06.997 --> 48:08.332
Lot's of pressure.

48:08.582 --> 48:10.042
Sure they are, sir.

48:15.589 --> 48:16.590
Oh.

48:18.258 --> 48:20.052
There's one thing
I almost forgot.

48:20.135 --> 48:21.470
Do you have
another minute, sir?

48:21.512 --> 48:22.513
Certainly.

48:22.554 --> 48:24.640
It's just one other
thing that bothers me.

48:24.681 --> 48:26.725
Would you mind
closing the door, Lieutenant?

48:27.226 --> 48:28.227
Uh,

48:29.269 --> 48:31.063
you know
it's almost 35 miles

48:31.146 --> 48:32.564
from the hotel
to your beach house.

48:32.648 --> 48:33.649
I believe so.

48:33.816 --> 48:34.858
That's if you go direct.

48:34.942 --> 48:36.568
If you drive around,
it could be more.

48:36.652 --> 48:37.986
Of course.

48:38.195 --> 48:39.530
Here's what bothers me, sir.

48:39.613 --> 48:41.115
I personally made
that trip myself.

48:41.198 --> 48:45.202
And, uh, I didn't race
the motor, you know.

48:45.285 --> 48:46.912
Normal speed,

48:46.995 --> 48:49.456
and I went in the evening,
it was cool.

48:49.581 --> 48:52.835
And I didn't go in traffic,
no startin' and stoppin'.

48:53.419 --> 48:54.670
So, uh...

48:54.712 --> 48:56.296
Would you get to the point,
Lieutenant?

48:56.380 --> 48:58.090
Yeah, it's just that, uh...

48:58.549 --> 49:00.801
Well, it took
an hour and 50 minutes

49:00.884 --> 49:02.428
for the engine to cool.

49:02.845 --> 49:03.887
And, uh,

49:04.847 --> 49:07.182
Mr. Stone died,
according to his watch,

49:07.266 --> 49:08.767
at 9:20.

49:09.226 --> 49:11.019
I arrived at the scene
of crime at 10:00,

49:11.103 --> 49:12.688
43 minutes later.

49:13.272 --> 49:15.983
When I put my hand
on the engine of your car,

49:16.150 --> 49:17.443
it was cold.

49:19.570 --> 49:22.614
All the heat was gone.
In only 43 minutes.

49:24.867 --> 49:26.368
And your conclusion?

49:26.994 --> 49:28.495
No conclusion, sir.

49:29.038 --> 49:31.206
I just thought
it was strange.

49:31.498 --> 49:33.375
Thought I'd mention it.

49:33.876 --> 49:35.752
Thank you very much.

49:55.104 --> 49:57.190
Mr. Hayward,
I forgot to mention,

49:57.356 --> 49:58.775
we got so involved,

49:58.858 --> 50:01.235
but I've asked to be assigned
to your security detail.

50:01.277 --> 50:02.737
I just wanted you
to know about it.

50:02.779 --> 50:04.530
Oh, Lieutenant, I'd hate
to take you away

50:04.614 --> 50:05.656
from your other duties.

50:05.740 --> 50:07.575
I'm sure
I'm adequately protected.

50:07.617 --> 50:09.410
Oh, no reflection on the guys
on the job,

50:09.452 --> 50:10.703
they're first class.

50:10.787 --> 50:11.996
Now it's just that,

50:12.080 --> 50:14.540
day before the election,
we consider it a crucial time

50:14.624 --> 50:16.125
in terms of security.

50:16.292 --> 50:17.835
I understand.

50:19.295 --> 50:21.714
Lieutenant, it'll be a comfort
to know you're around.

50:21.798 --> 50:23.549
Thank you very much.

50:24.300 --> 50:26.135
Sir, uh, can I ask you
a personal question?

50:26.219 --> 50:27.595
Yeah.

50:27.678 --> 50:29.430
Nothing to do
with the case.

50:29.514 --> 50:31.057
What did you pay
for the jacket?

50:31.224 --> 50:32.767
Well, I don't remember
exactly...

50:32.850 --> 50:34.602
Not that one, sir.
The other one.

50:34.685 --> 50:35.770
The other one?

50:35.853 --> 50:37.105
Just a minute.

50:41.567 --> 50:43.152
This one here.
Just arrived.

50:43.236 --> 50:45.238
Oh, uh,
$200, I think.

50:45.321 --> 50:46.739
No, just the jacket.

50:46.864 --> 50:48.282
That's the price.
$200.

50:48.825 --> 50:50.201
No pants?

50:50.284 --> 50:52.120
After all,
it was tailor-made for me.

50:52.578 --> 50:54.288
Actually,
I had second thoughts

50:54.330 --> 50:55.873
about this jacket.
It's, uh...

50:56.165 --> 50:57.500
It's identical
to the one

50:57.583 --> 50:59.877
that Harry was wearing
when, uh, when you found him.

50:59.961 --> 51:01.129
Yeah, I noticed that.

51:01.170 --> 51:02.922
Uh, where do you get
a jacket like that?

51:03.005 --> 51:04.173
From my tailors.

51:04.257 --> 51:05.508
Chadwick's,
in Beverly Hills.

51:06.926 --> 51:08.636
Why, Lieutenant,
are you, uh, considering

51:08.720 --> 51:09.679
a change of wardrobe?

51:09.762 --> 51:12.640
Oh, no, no.
Oh, every once in a while

51:12.682 --> 51:14.350
I think about
getting a new coat.

51:14.434 --> 51:15.435
There's no rush.

51:15.518 --> 51:17.478
There's still a lot of
wearing in this fellow.

51:17.520 --> 51:18.813
Looks very functional.
Thank you.

51:18.896 --> 51:20.398
Lieutenant, uh,
really, if, uh,

51:20.481 --> 51:22.442
if there's
nothing else, uh...

51:22.525 --> 51:24.819
I got a special affair
coming up Saturday night

51:24.861 --> 51:26.738
and I'm in the market
for a coat.

51:26.821 --> 51:28.448
I see. Good bye.

51:44.212 --> 51:46.506
Yes. Appreciate it very much.

51:46.590 --> 51:48.383
You're leaving
for Monaco tomorrow, huh?

51:48.467 --> 51:50.886
The family?
Good. Bon voyage.

51:51.595 --> 51:54.014
Mrs. Armstrong,
we'll see you back. Yes.

51:54.848 --> 51:57.559
Uh, may we
assist you, sir?

51:57.893 --> 51:59.770
Uh, yeah,
I'm looking for a jacket.

51:59.853 --> 52:02.314
Do you have anything, uh,
particular in mind?

52:02.397 --> 52:05.233
Uh, yeah, but, uh,

52:05.609 --> 52:07.152
I don't see
any jackets here.

52:07.235 --> 52:09.780
Well, naturally,
our clothes are custom-made.

52:09.863 --> 52:11.740
Yeah, I understand,
but I thought you'd have

52:11.823 --> 52:13.992
a model, at least something
that you could look at.

52:14.076 --> 52:16.161
Well, exactly what
did you have in mind?

52:16.870 --> 52:18.205
A sport jacket.

52:18.372 --> 52:19.748
Any particular material?

52:20.916 --> 52:23.251
Uh, something soft.

52:23.335 --> 52:24.544
Cashmere?

52:26.296 --> 52:27.547
It could be.

52:27.589 --> 52:28.715
Flannel?

52:29.257 --> 52:31.176
Flannel?
Is that soft?

52:31.259 --> 52:33.136
Camel hair, that's nice.

52:33.428 --> 52:34.638
Soft. Is it soft?

52:34.721 --> 52:35.931
Soft, yes.

52:36.014 --> 52:37.766
Uh, any particular
color?

52:37.849 --> 52:39.351
Brown.

52:39.434 --> 52:41.311
But there are so many
shades of brown, sir,

52:41.395 --> 52:43.647
there's, uh,
midnight brown...

52:43.730 --> 52:44.898
Light brown.

52:44.940 --> 52:46.983
On the light side?
Uh, cream.

52:48.151 --> 52:49.152
Um...

52:49.778 --> 52:51.154
Light. In that area.

52:51.238 --> 52:53.949
Yes, uh, um, tan.
Would you say tan?

52:55.283 --> 52:56.368
Could be
in that area.

52:56.451 --> 52:57.452
More on
the tan side.

52:57.536 --> 52:58.495
A light brown.

52:58.578 --> 53:00.038
Something like between
this and this.

53:00.122 --> 53:01.206
Let me show you
something.

53:01.289 --> 53:02.249
Fine.

53:02.332 --> 53:04.251
This material we call
Sands of Morocco.

53:04.334 --> 53:05.877
Came in last week.
Delightful.

53:05.961 --> 53:07.003
No.
No lines.

53:07.087 --> 53:09.172
No. No lines.
Oh, yes, you did say

53:10.132 --> 53:11.341
you did say
light and beige.

53:11.425 --> 53:12.676
This one, sir?
Right here.

53:12.884 --> 53:14.761
Uh, it's too rough.

53:15.679 --> 53:17.097
All right.
Let's try this one.

53:18.056 --> 53:21.268
I'm sure this is
a very good material.

53:21.351 --> 53:23.353
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that's it.

53:23.437 --> 53:24.396
Softness?

53:24.479 --> 53:25.981
Yeah, that's it.

53:26.189 --> 53:27.441
Oh, that's beautiful.

53:27.524 --> 53:29.109
Yes.
Yes, it is.

53:29.234 --> 53:30.235
Yeah.

53:30.609 --> 53:33.029
Okay, now let me
ask you something.

53:33.237 --> 53:35.740
If I had a jacket
made up in this material,

53:35.823 --> 53:37.950
now, would that be
something that would fit me?

53:38.034 --> 53:39.535
Monsieur, we have
the finest tailors

53:39.618 --> 53:40.703
in all the world.

53:40.786 --> 53:41.746
No, I don't mean...

53:41.829 --> 53:43.914
We've been in this business
for quite some time.

53:43.998 --> 53:45.583
No, I don't mean
that it would fit me.

53:45.666 --> 53:47.626
What I mean is that
whether it would fit my...

53:47.710 --> 53:48.711
Your personality?

53:48.794 --> 53:49.962
Style. Right.

53:50.046 --> 53:52.840
Yes. I guarantee
you'll be most satisfied.

53:52.923 --> 53:54.508
Because I want to look...

53:54.592 --> 53:56.218
I'm going to an affair,
you see.

53:56.302 --> 53:58.137
Oh, splendid,
an affair, very nice.

53:58.179 --> 54:00.181
Yeah, my wife's
bowling league's

54:00.264 --> 54:01.515
having this dinner dance.

54:01.599 --> 54:04.977
It's an annual thing,
$17.50 a couple.

54:05.061 --> 54:06.771
I want to look good.

54:06.896 --> 54:08.647
Your wife.
Very well, sir.

54:08.731 --> 54:10.524
You think this
will be all right?

54:10.608 --> 54:11.692
Oh, yes,
quite sure. Mario.

54:11.776 --> 54:15.321
All right, all right,
let me take one of them.

54:17.656 --> 54:19.825
You'll have that
ready by Saturday?

54:22.703 --> 54:25.664
Well, sir, I,
um, I'm afraid

54:25.873 --> 54:28.167
that is one of the things
we cannot do.

54:28.209 --> 54:29.293
No, you see,

54:29.377 --> 54:31.462
our customers are required
to allow us at least,

54:31.545 --> 54:33.798
at least 10 days
following first fitting.

54:33.881 --> 54:34.840
Ten days?

54:34.924 --> 54:36.967
Thank you.
Excuse me, sir.

54:37.885 --> 54:39.053
Oh, it's 10 days?

54:39.136 --> 54:40.054
Yes.

54:40.221 --> 54:41.180
Oh.

54:41.555 --> 54:44.642
Look, I... I was kind of
afraid of that, but, uh...

54:45.893 --> 54:48.396
I'll tell you who
sent me over here.

54:48.562 --> 54:50.606
A friend of mine.
Mr. Nelson Hayward.

54:50.689 --> 54:52.400
He gave me your name.

54:52.483 --> 54:53.818
So I thought
that maybe you could

54:53.901 --> 54:56.404
give me a... a rush job,
like you gave him

54:56.487 --> 54:58.155
because he told me
he had one delivered

54:58.239 --> 54:59.490
just like that today.

54:59.573 --> 55:00.574
I saw it.

55:00.700 --> 55:01.659
Mr. Hayward?

55:01.742 --> 55:02.993
You did say
Mr. Nelson Hayward?

55:03.077 --> 55:04.036
Yeah.

55:04.120 --> 55:06.664
Mario, do you...
Oh, yes. I... I do recall.

55:06.747 --> 55:08.624
Yes. That... that delivery
was made today.

55:08.708 --> 55:10.501
Oh, yes,
I'm quite sure.

55:10.584 --> 55:12.503
Uh, but as I recall,

55:12.586 --> 55:14.588
the garment
that was ordered

55:14.755 --> 55:17.800
to be first fitted for
Mr. Hayward was on the, uh,

55:20.761 --> 55:22.346
was on the 16th.

55:23.097 --> 55:24.056
Oh.

55:24.598 --> 55:26.475
Oh, that long, huh?
May I see that?

55:26.559 --> 55:27.852
Yes.

55:28.102 --> 55:30.270
Well, 10 days.

55:30.979 --> 55:34.232
Right. Well,
that's a problem.

55:35.275 --> 55:37.027
The affair is
Saturday night. Uh...

55:37.110 --> 55:40.405
Uh, perhaps, may I suggest,
uh, department stores?

55:41.990 --> 55:43.324
Right.

55:43.658 --> 55:44.784
Thank you very much.

55:44.868 --> 55:46.244
All right.

55:54.127 --> 55:57.756
Thank you.
It is with a real pleasure

55:57.839 --> 55:59.215
that we dedicate

55:59.299 --> 56:01.634
this community
recreation center.

56:01.718 --> 56:04.012
The California
Human Relations Society

56:04.095 --> 56:06.181
can be proud of
its achievement

56:06.306 --> 56:08.433
in helping maintain and create

56:08.475 --> 56:11.603
new social
and recreational facilities

56:11.686 --> 56:13.313
such as this one.

56:13.396 --> 56:14.439
Thank you.

56:16.232 --> 56:18.526
Thank you very much.
That's very nice.

56:19.277 --> 56:20.362
Bye-bye.

56:21.112 --> 56:22.072
Hello.

56:26.618 --> 56:28.578
Excuse me. Sorry.

56:28.703 --> 56:30.163
Excuse me. Sorry.

56:30.246 --> 56:32.540
Ma'am. Ma'am.

56:33.333 --> 56:35.043
No, thank you
very much.

56:35.335 --> 56:37.629
Ma'am, we've
never officially met.

56:37.712 --> 56:40.465
I'm from the Police.
Lt. Columbo.

56:40.548 --> 56:42.884
I'm investigating
Mr. Stone's murder.

56:45.553 --> 56:48.473
Oh, Mrs. Hayward will be
through in a few minutes.

56:48.556 --> 56:49.641
Actually,
I was wondering

56:49.724 --> 56:51.893
if I might have a word
with you.

56:52.268 --> 56:53.561
Will you do this
for me now?

56:53.645 --> 56:54.604
Sure.

56:54.687 --> 56:56.147
I don't know
anything about the case.

56:56.231 --> 56:57.649
Excuse me.

56:58.066 --> 57:00.193
Miss Johnson.
Miss Johnson.

57:01.236 --> 57:02.278
That's your name?

57:02.362 --> 57:03.446
Yes.

57:03.530 --> 57:05.031
You'd be surprised
how helpful

57:05.115 --> 57:06.658
people on the scene
can be.

57:07.200 --> 57:08.451
Let me see.

57:10.412 --> 57:12.539
You're Mrs. Hayward's
appointments secretary.

57:12.622 --> 57:13.665
That's right.

57:13.748 --> 57:15.792
Could you tell me about
the arrangements you made

57:15.875 --> 57:17.252
for Mrs. Hayward's
surprise party

57:17.335 --> 57:18.461
the night of the murder?

57:18.545 --> 57:19.879
I didn't make
the arrangements.

57:19.963 --> 57:21.172
You didn't?

57:21.256 --> 57:22.465
Uh-huh.

57:22.549 --> 57:25.009
Oh, that's funny.

57:25.552 --> 57:26.927
Why is that?

57:27.344 --> 57:28.303
Uh,

57:28.387 --> 57:30.389
you know, my wife
is very well-organized.

57:30.472 --> 57:32.266
I mean she takes care
of our social life.

57:32.349 --> 57:34.059
I work these
strange hours, you see.

57:34.143 --> 57:35.644
So I just assumed
that somebody

57:35.728 --> 57:36.687
as busy as Mr. Hayward

57:36.812 --> 57:38.772
would have somebody else
set up these things.

57:38.856 --> 57:40.232
Well, then, maybe
you should ask

57:40.315 --> 57:42.609
Mr. Hayward's secretary.
Excuse me.

57:44.570 --> 57:45.821
I did ask her.

57:45.904 --> 57:47.114
Didn't know
anything about it.

57:48.323 --> 57:51.160
Well, what do you want
me to do about it?

57:51.243 --> 57:53.120
Is Mr. Hayward good
about these things?

57:53.245 --> 57:55.164
Birthday parties,
sentimental occasions?

57:55.247 --> 57:57.041
Well, I don't know
Mr. Hayward that well,

57:57.124 --> 57:59.043
but I understand that
he is quite thoughtful

57:59.084 --> 58:00.419
and considerate.

58:00.502 --> 58:03.005
Could Mr. Hayward have made
these arrangements?

58:03.088 --> 58:04.882
I really don't know,
Lieutenant.

58:04.923 --> 58:06.842
Could Mr. Stone have made
those arrangements?

58:06.925 --> 58:08.302
Oh, what difference
does it make?

58:08.385 --> 58:09.511
I don't know, Lieutenant.

58:09.595 --> 58:12.014
No difference. By itself.

58:12.931 --> 58:16.226
But if I could find out
who made the arrangements,

58:16.435 --> 58:19.730
then I wouldn't be so troubled
by this other thing.

58:19.897 --> 58:20.939
What thing?

58:21.023 --> 58:22.191
The fact that Mr. Stone

58:22.274 --> 58:24.234
never knew anything
about a party.

58:25.444 --> 58:27.488
Mr. Stone didn't
know there was a party?

58:27.571 --> 58:29.365
No, ma'am.

58:29.448 --> 58:31.325
How do you know that,
Lieutenant?

58:31.450 --> 58:33.369
I checked
his appointments calendar.

58:36.038 --> 58:38.332
Oh, maybe it was
just an oversight.

58:39.958 --> 58:41.752
Mr. Stone
was very efficient.

58:41.794 --> 58:43.295
And my notes say
that from the start

58:43.379 --> 58:45.089
of the campaign
till now, he kept

58:45.130 --> 58:47.549
a detailed record
of Mr. Hayward's schedule.

58:47.633 --> 58:49.176
Knew where to reach him.
Every hour.

58:49.259 --> 58:50.594
Night or day.

58:50.719 --> 58:52.763
Not one word
about the party.

58:54.598 --> 58:56.725
But they weren't
close socially.

58:57.101 --> 58:58.268
Why is that?

58:58.310 --> 59:00.270
Uh, different kind
of men.

59:00.312 --> 59:01.522
In what way?

59:01.689 --> 59:04.692
Mr. Stone was rather crude,
rather aggressive.

59:04.775 --> 59:06.276
You knew
Mr. Stone very well?

59:06.443 --> 59:07.986
No, not really.

59:08.237 --> 59:10.614
I was just
wondering who hired you.

59:10.948 --> 59:13.075
Um, actually
Mr. Hayward hired me.

59:13.158 --> 59:15.953
I was doing
some, uh, volunteer work

59:15.994 --> 59:17.287
during the primary.

59:17.371 --> 59:18.622
I can understand that.

59:18.706 --> 59:19.915
He's a very attractive man.

59:19.998 --> 59:21.583
Yes, I like him, Lieutenant.

59:21.667 --> 59:23.210
I like him for
what he represents.

59:23.293 --> 59:25.712
He's a man of
great courage and integrity.

59:25.795 --> 59:28.423
Well, I'm sure that's
what attracted you to him

59:28.506 --> 59:30.174
as a candidate.

59:31.843 --> 59:33.052
May I say this?

59:33.136 --> 59:34.971
I think you're
a wonderful girl.

59:35.012 --> 59:37.306
And I think that Mr. Hayward
is... is very lucky

59:37.390 --> 59:39.642
to have someone like you
supporting him.

59:39.684 --> 59:41.102
Thank you.

59:41.227 --> 59:42.645
Thank you very much.

59:45.023 --> 59:46.149
Sorry.

01:00:03.875 --> 01:00:05.877
Excuse me, Officer.
Could you help me out?

01:00:05.918 --> 01:00:07.545
Pull right up there,
please.

01:00:07.628 --> 01:00:08.838
I was wondering,
do you know...

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:11.716
Just pull it up there, huh.
Thank you.

01:00:20.516 --> 01:00:22.393
You know where, uh,
Ridgeway Drive is?

01:00:22.477 --> 01:00:24.270
I'm afraid I don't
know this neighborhood.

01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:26.064
May I see your
driver's license, please?

01:00:26.147 --> 01:00:27.065
Yeah.

01:00:27.148 --> 01:00:30.360
I'm on the force, LAPD.
Lt. Columbo.

01:00:30.401 --> 01:00:32.695
Uh, you have any
identification, Lieutenant?

01:00:32.779 --> 01:00:34.238
Yeah.

01:00:36.908 --> 01:00:38.951
Always in the wrong pocket.

01:00:46.459 --> 01:00:48.878
This isn't
a Department car, is it?

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:50.713
No, this is mine.

01:00:50.922 --> 01:00:52.965
Well, I'll have to inspect
your car, Lieutenant.

01:00:53.049 --> 01:00:54.258
Oh, that's all right.

01:00:54.342 --> 01:00:55.843
May I see your license,
please?

01:00:55.927 --> 01:00:57.011
Yeah.

01:01:18.491 --> 01:01:20.618
You still live at the
same address, Lieutenant?

01:01:20.702 --> 01:01:23.453
Yeah. Look, I just had
it in for a checkup,

01:01:23.537 --> 01:01:25.872
only, uh, you know, a tune-up,
two months ago.

01:01:25.956 --> 01:01:28.417
Well, it'll only take a couple
of moments, Lieutenant.

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:31.253
Would you try, uh, your lights
and your turn signal, please,

01:01:31.336 --> 01:01:33.338
and open the hood for me?

01:01:35.674 --> 01:01:38.385
This is
Lt. Columbo, LAPD.

01:01:38.468 --> 01:01:40.011
Hi, Lieutenant.

01:01:40.095 --> 01:01:41.930
I'm looking for
Ridgeway Drive.

01:01:41.972 --> 01:01:44.641
Ridgewood, uh,
three blocks, turn left

01:01:45.308 --> 01:01:46.518
and go about
a mile and a half.

01:01:46.601 --> 01:01:48.645
It's on your right hand side.
You can't miss it.

01:01:48.729 --> 01:01:49.730
Thanks.

01:01:49.813 --> 01:01:51.356
Lieutenant, would you kindly

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:53.150
turn on your
windshield wipers?

01:02:04.494 --> 01:02:06.830
They were working
perfect yesterday.

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:09.458
I must've lost one
in a car wash.

01:02:12.169 --> 01:02:14.671
Sign right here,
please, Lieutenant.

01:02:16.798 --> 01:02:17.966
Everything all right?

01:02:18.008 --> 01:02:19.801
Your right turn
signal is out.

01:02:19.843 --> 01:02:21.428
Your high beam
doesn't work

01:02:21.511 --> 01:02:23.513
and your smog device
is leaking.

01:02:23.597 --> 01:02:25.682
One of those
windshield wipers is out, too.

01:02:25.766 --> 01:02:28.518
You'll have two weeks
to correct these things.

01:02:28.602 --> 01:02:30.354
Thank you very much.

01:02:30.937 --> 01:02:33.940
You ever, uh, considered
getting another car?

01:02:34.316 --> 01:02:36.276
I got another car.
My wife drives it.

01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:37.652
But that's nothing special.

01:02:37.778 --> 01:02:39.071
Just transportation.

01:02:41.948 --> 01:02:43.325
Thanks for the directions.

01:02:43.450 --> 01:02:44.826
You're welcome.

01:05:08.803 --> 01:05:10.137
Car is ready.

01:05:10.221 --> 01:05:11.972
Okay. Listen, uh,

01:05:12.556 --> 01:05:14.600
thank you very much
for the loan of the truck.

01:05:14.684 --> 01:05:15.643
That helped me out.

01:05:15.685 --> 01:05:17.728
Saved me a little time

01:05:18.687 --> 01:05:20.563
and here's a little
something for you.

01:05:20.647 --> 01:05:22.774
No problem.
Your bill's over here.

01:05:30.198 --> 01:05:33.243
That'll be, uh,
$65.25.

01:05:40.709 --> 01:05:42.711
That much, huh?

01:05:42.877 --> 01:05:44.838
Not the parts so much
as the time it took.

01:05:44.963 --> 01:05:47.757
It's not easy to work
on a car in that condition.

01:05:50.218 --> 01:05:51.636
You take a check?

01:05:51.761 --> 01:05:53.179
You haven't got
a credit card?

01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:55.974
Uh, I'm
from the police.

01:05:57.726 --> 01:05:59.436
Lt. Columbo.

01:06:07.027 --> 01:06:09.070
What are you
undercover or something?

01:06:09.195 --> 01:06:11.281
No, I'm underpaid.

01:06:11.906 --> 01:06:13.700
What about the check,
would you take one?

01:06:13.742 --> 01:06:15.827
Yeah. Sure,
I'll take a check.

01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:16.870
Okay.

01:06:27.088 --> 01:06:28.548
I was sure I
brought my checkbook,

01:06:28.631 --> 01:06:29.966
maybe I left it
at home.

01:06:30.175 --> 01:06:31.718
You have
a countercheck?

01:06:31.885 --> 01:06:33.803
Yeah. Over here.

01:06:43.938 --> 01:06:44.939
Here.

01:06:50.445 --> 01:06:51.446
Oh.

01:06:54.991 --> 01:06:57.911
You investigating that murder
last week at the beach?

01:06:57.994 --> 01:06:59.162
Yeah.

01:06:59.245 --> 01:07:00.246
My luck.

01:07:00.330 --> 01:07:01.915
One night we have
a little excitement

01:07:01.998 --> 01:07:03.208
and I miss it.

01:07:03.666 --> 01:07:04.626
What do you mean?

01:07:04.709 --> 01:07:06.127
Wednesday night
we ran out of gas.

01:07:06.211 --> 01:07:08.213
Closed at 8:00.

01:07:08.671 --> 01:07:10.215
Closed?

01:07:15.178 --> 01:07:16.178
Yes.

01:07:17.096 --> 01:07:18.305
Yeah, I know.

01:07:18.639 --> 01:07:20.599
You better bring us
blue suits down there.

01:07:20.641 --> 01:07:22.601
And a fresh shirt
and tie.

01:07:22.685 --> 01:07:23.894
Yeah, I'll be
all right.

01:07:23.977 --> 01:07:25.854
Black shoes
and black socks.

01:07:25.938 --> 01:07:27.064
Mr. Hayward.

01:07:27.147 --> 01:07:28.107
Yes?

01:07:28.148 --> 01:07:29.733
May I see you?

01:07:29.817 --> 01:07:31.402
Excuse me a minute,
gentlemen.

01:07:34.363 --> 01:07:36.448
That policeman who was at
campaign headquarters

01:07:36.532 --> 01:07:37.658
this morning?

01:07:37.741 --> 01:07:40.452
He showed up at
the dedication this afternoon.

01:07:40.494 --> 01:07:41.537
What did he want?

01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:43.288
He makes me nervous.

01:07:43.372 --> 01:07:45.124
What did he want?

01:07:45.207 --> 01:07:46.750
He wanted to
know why Harry Stone

01:07:46.834 --> 01:07:49.002
didn't know about
your wife's surprise party.

01:07:50.170 --> 01:07:51.463
What does it mean?

01:07:51.505 --> 01:07:52.715
Nothing. Nothing.

01:07:52.798 --> 01:07:55.801
Just trying to make a name
for himself, darling.

01:07:56.218 --> 01:07:57.678
Don't get nervous.

01:07:57.761 --> 01:07:59.847
The important thing
is that you don't get upset.

01:07:59.930 --> 01:08:01.432
Don't let him
get to you.

01:08:01.557 --> 01:08:03.100
Okay.

01:08:05.102 --> 01:08:06.437
Gentlemen?

01:08:07.563 --> 01:08:08.939
Oh, Mr. Hayward?

01:08:13.861 --> 01:08:16.071
What is it you want,
Lieutenant?

01:08:16.488 --> 01:08:17.698
Oh, nothing, sir.

01:08:17.781 --> 01:08:19.616
I'm just looking for
the head security guy.

01:08:19.658 --> 01:08:21.076
They told me
he was up here.

01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:22.703
I think I'm working
that 8:00 shift.

01:08:22.786 --> 01:08:24.621
I can't wait
to get started.

01:08:24.747 --> 01:08:26.582
Uh, I last saw him
in the kitchen.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.793
Oh. Oh, thank you
very much.

01:08:33.839 --> 01:08:35.090
Oh, sir,

01:08:36.216 --> 01:08:37.885
listen, a couple of things
came up

01:08:37.968 --> 01:08:39.261
that I want to
discuss with you,

01:08:39.345 --> 01:08:40.804
but I don't want to
burden you now,

01:08:40.888 --> 01:08:42.931
because I can see you got
a lot on your mind.

01:08:43.015 --> 01:08:44.224
Quite to the contrary.

01:08:44.308 --> 01:08:45.934
There's no time
like the present.

01:08:46.518 --> 01:08:47.686
What can I
do for you?

01:08:47.728 --> 01:08:49.813
Why don't you gentlemen go on
and wait in the patio.

01:08:49.897 --> 01:08:50.814
I'll be right there.

01:08:50.898 --> 01:08:52.858
Oh, listen, I don't want
to inconvenience you.

01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:53.984
Not at all.

01:08:54.068 --> 01:08:55.444
You got this TV
thing on you mind.

01:08:55.527 --> 01:08:57.196
No, no, no,
let's understand something.

01:08:57.237 --> 01:08:58.781
You see,
you think I'm reluctant

01:08:58.864 --> 01:09:00.616
to talk to you.
But you're wrong.

01:09:00.949 --> 01:09:03.369
I will talk to you
as often as you want,

01:09:03.494 --> 01:09:05.204
for as long
as you want

01:09:05.245 --> 01:09:06.955
about anything
you want.

01:09:08.707 --> 01:09:09.708
Okay.

01:09:11.168 --> 01:09:12.169
Oh, fine.

01:09:13.295 --> 01:09:15.171
Well, uh, I'll tell you,
one of the things

01:09:15.254 --> 01:09:16.547
that's bothering me...

01:09:16.589 --> 01:09:17.882
Why don't we
sit down, eh?

01:09:17.924 --> 01:09:19.884
Sit down here.
Make yourself comfortable.

01:09:19.926 --> 01:09:21.427
Thank you very much.

01:09:21.803 --> 01:09:22.804
Uh,

01:09:23.388 --> 01:09:25.264
one of the things
that's bothering me...

01:09:25.348 --> 01:09:27.308
Would you like a drink?
I'll fix you a drink.

01:09:27.392 --> 01:09:28.851
No. Thank you very much.
No.

01:09:28.935 --> 01:09:31.896
Uh, you see, uh...

01:09:33.147 --> 01:09:34.565
You make me feel
so important,

01:09:34.607 --> 01:09:36.526
I forgot
what I was going to say.

01:09:36.567 --> 01:09:39.070
Uh... Oh.

01:09:39.237 --> 01:09:40.446
Well, listen,
let me start with

01:09:40.530 --> 01:09:41.948
how much I like
your jacket.

01:09:43.491 --> 01:09:45.118
I really love it.

01:09:45.576 --> 01:09:46.994
Do you mind?

01:09:52.250 --> 01:09:53.418
Soft as butter.

01:09:53.543 --> 01:09:54.711
Camel's hair.

01:09:56.045 --> 01:09:58.631
Would you believe it?
The first thing I did this morning

01:09:58.715 --> 01:10:00.425
when I left your
campaign headquarters,

01:10:00.508 --> 01:10:02.552
I run right over
to your tailor's.

01:10:02.593 --> 01:10:04.137
I'm sure
he was delighted.

01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:05.680
He loves
a challenge.

01:10:05.763 --> 01:10:07.056
What do you
mean, sir?

01:10:07.140 --> 01:10:08.891
Nothing, nothing,
it's a small joke.

01:10:09.434 --> 01:10:12.353
Oh, you mean about fitting me?
I'm not hard to fit.

01:10:12.478 --> 01:10:15.023
No, just the legs.
Now, something goes funny

01:10:15.106 --> 01:10:17.108
in here with the legs,
but, uh...

01:10:17.191 --> 01:10:19.110
Uh, jackets, I pick them
right off the rack,

01:10:19.193 --> 01:10:20.611
they fit like a glove.

01:10:20.653 --> 01:10:23.740
I didn't go to the guy
for a good fit. No, sir.

01:10:24.282 --> 01:10:27.076
Well, I went for the material.
And you know what?

01:10:27.535 --> 01:10:28.536
And, uh...

01:10:29.287 --> 01:10:32.373
This is the thing
that bothers me.

01:10:34.208 --> 01:10:36.919
It takes this guy
10 days to make a jacket.

01:10:37.754 --> 01:10:39.464
And you
need one by...

01:10:39.547 --> 01:10:40.840
Saturday.

01:10:41.299 --> 01:10:42.508
Too bad.

01:10:43.092 --> 01:10:45.094
But that's not
what bothers me.

01:10:45.887 --> 01:10:47.221
No, my problem is...

01:10:47.305 --> 01:10:49.474
Lieutenant, I'm going to
make myself a drink.

01:10:49.557 --> 01:10:50.975
You sure
I can't fix you one?

01:10:51.059 --> 01:10:52.226
No.

01:10:52.352 --> 01:10:54.145
You were saying
your problem is...

01:10:54.228 --> 01:10:57.231
Yes, I was saying
that my problem is

01:10:58.816 --> 01:11:01.986
the jacket that you're wearing
was delivered today

01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:05.281
which would mean that you
had to order it 10 days ago.

01:11:05.365 --> 01:11:07.283
But the one that you
gave to Mr. Stone

01:11:07.367 --> 01:11:09.994
was only ruined four days ago
when he got shot.

01:11:10.161 --> 01:11:11.120
And, uh,

01:11:11.746 --> 01:11:13.997
I just don't understand
how you would know

01:11:14.039 --> 01:11:15.248
six days in advance

01:11:15.332 --> 01:11:17.793
that you would
need a new jacket.

01:11:17.876 --> 01:11:19.795
Oh, excuse me, Mr. Hayward,
uh, the director

01:11:19.836 --> 01:11:22.089
would like to check
some camera angles.

01:11:23.423 --> 01:11:26.093
Lieutenant, did you happen
to examine the jacket?

01:11:26.176 --> 01:11:27.386
The old one?

01:11:27.469 --> 01:11:29.471
Me, personally?
No, sir.

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:32.182
Because, if you had taken
the trouble to examine it,

01:11:32.265 --> 01:11:34.601
you'd have found that
the cuffs had begun to fray

01:11:34.685 --> 01:11:36.228
and there was
a little cigarette burn

01:11:36.311 --> 01:11:37.604
in the left sleeve.

01:11:37.688 --> 01:11:40.774
That's why, 10 days ago,
I ordered a new jacket.

01:11:44.027 --> 01:11:46.071
Uh, what was it
you wanted?

01:11:46.697 --> 01:11:48.532
The director would
like to see you, please.

01:11:49.908 --> 01:11:51.868
Have I satisfied
you about the jacket?

01:11:52.536 --> 01:11:54.037
Yes, sir.

01:11:54.121 --> 01:11:56.123
All right if we walk and talk?
Do you mind?

01:11:57.374 --> 01:11:58.375
No.

01:12:01.670 --> 01:12:02.671
Well,

01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:04.840
uh,

01:12:06.091 --> 01:12:09.011
this other thing
really troubles me, sir.

01:12:10.137 --> 01:12:12.681
Just a minute.
I don't want to forget that.

01:12:13.849 --> 01:12:16.309
Yes, this other thing
is a genuine puzzle.

01:12:16.768 --> 01:12:18.562
I don't see
any answer to this.

01:12:18.687 --> 01:12:20.439
Well, maybe
I can help you.

01:12:21.732 --> 01:12:23.483
Let's hope so, sir.

01:12:24.234 --> 01:12:25.819
For your sake or mine?

01:12:41.793 --> 01:12:43.336
You're in good humor, sir.

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.422
I like to win.

01:12:46.131 --> 01:12:48.050
Oh, well.

01:12:48.383 --> 01:12:50.177
As I was saying, uh,

01:12:50.302 --> 01:12:53.055
I don't see
any answer here, sir.

01:12:53.096 --> 01:12:54.556
Uh, I went out to
your beach house

01:12:54.598 --> 01:12:56.433
this afternoon.

01:12:56.516 --> 01:12:58.435
I pulled out of your garage,
and I roared

01:12:58.477 --> 01:13:00.354
down the street
at 70 miles an hour

01:13:00.437 --> 01:13:02.022
and after three minutes
I stopped

01:13:02.105 --> 01:13:03.857
and there was
nothing there.

01:13:04.399 --> 01:13:07.319
No bar, no restaurant,
no gas station,

01:13:07.944 --> 01:13:10.488
not even a private house.
Nothing.

01:13:10.738 --> 01:13:14.200
Just a field,
highway, and birds.

01:13:16.535 --> 01:13:17.912
What were you
looking for?

01:13:17.953 --> 01:13:19.372
A phone, sir.

01:13:19.455 --> 01:13:20.581
A phone?

01:13:20.623 --> 01:13:21.874
Yes, sir.

01:13:22.333 --> 01:13:23.876
Mr. Stone's broken watch

01:13:23.959 --> 01:13:26.087
fixed the time
of death at 9:20.

01:13:26.504 --> 01:13:29.048
The killer's phone call
came into the police

01:13:29.131 --> 01:13:32.218
at exactly 9:23.

01:13:33.594 --> 01:13:35.721
Where did
the killer call from?

01:13:36.764 --> 01:13:38.891
That's what
I can't answer.

01:13:38.974 --> 01:13:40.643
Closest public phone

01:13:40.685 --> 01:13:43.104
is seven minutes away
in a gasoline station.

01:13:48.943 --> 01:13:50.319
Beats me, sir.

01:13:50.403 --> 01:13:52.279
And I've considered
every possibility.

01:13:53.614 --> 01:13:54.699
You're sure?

01:13:54.824 --> 01:13:56.450
As far
as I know, yes.

01:13:58.828 --> 01:14:00.746
Tell me something,
Lieutenant.

01:14:01.122 --> 01:14:02.707
Did you know,
did you know

01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:04.500
that Harry Stone
always set his watch

01:14:04.542 --> 01:14:06.627
five minutes fast so
that he'd never be late

01:14:06.669 --> 01:14:08.295
for an appointment?
Did you know that?

01:14:08.671 --> 01:14:10.047
No, sir, I didn't.

01:14:10.256 --> 01:14:11.799
Everybody else knew that.

01:14:12.341 --> 01:14:14.260
Instead of the time
of death being 9:20,

01:14:14.343 --> 01:14:16.053
that would fix
it at 9:15.

01:14:16.137 --> 01:14:17.638
Now, you say
it takes him 7 minutes

01:14:17.722 --> 01:14:19.348
to go to the gas station.

01:14:19.432 --> 01:14:20.725
Isn't that
what you said?

01:14:20.808 --> 01:14:23.352
9:15 and seven
gives you 9:22.

01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:25.938
Plenty of time
to get out change,

01:14:26.022 --> 01:14:28.232
light a cigarette
and make a telephone call.

01:14:29.025 --> 01:14:30.609
Does that
answer your question?

01:14:30.693 --> 01:14:31.861
No, sir.

01:14:31.944 --> 01:14:34.905
Station ran out of gas.
Closed early. 8:00.

01:14:37.116 --> 01:14:40.870
Mr. Hayward, could we have you
now for a voice test, please?

01:14:41.871 --> 01:14:43.622
I think we've held
them up long enough.

01:14:43.706 --> 01:14:45.207
We'll talk later.

01:15:07.854 --> 01:15:09.356
What about the house phone?

01:15:09.397 --> 01:15:10.732
The murderer
could've telephoned

01:15:10.815 --> 01:15:11.900
from the beach house.

01:15:11.983 --> 01:15:14.652
My keys to my house
were right with the car keys.

01:15:14.736 --> 01:15:16.905
The call to the police
came in downtown.

01:15:16.988 --> 01:15:19.032
From your beach house,
that's a toll call.

01:15:19.074 --> 01:15:20.658
I checked
the telephone company.

01:15:20.742 --> 01:15:22.369
No record of a call.

01:15:29.459 --> 01:15:31.252
Want to step this way,
Mr. Hayward?

01:15:31.294 --> 01:15:33.046
We'll give you some marks over here.
Yeah.

01:15:33.088 --> 01:15:34.255
Here's
your ending mark.

01:15:34.339 --> 01:15:35.590
There.
Okay.

01:15:35.632 --> 01:15:38.677
Do you want to, uh, have me
just walking up to the camera,

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:40.804
or do you want to
discover me here right away?

01:15:40.887 --> 01:15:42.597
I presume
that the paid telephone

01:15:42.639 --> 01:15:44.557
in the gas station
was inside.

01:15:44.641 --> 01:15:45.725
Inside, sir?

01:15:46.101 --> 01:15:48.395
We'll have you walk
right into the camera,

01:15:48.436 --> 01:15:49.896
it'll make you
appear more relaxed.

01:15:49.938 --> 01:15:50.980
Okay.

01:15:51.064 --> 01:15:51.981
Yeah, sure.

01:15:52.065 --> 01:15:53.066
Fine, fine.

01:15:53.108 --> 01:15:54.317
Make up.

01:15:56.528 --> 01:15:58.071
Let me see
the tie.

01:15:58.196 --> 01:15:59.447
Okay, that's fine.
Thank you.

01:15:59.489 --> 01:16:00.573
Okay.

01:16:00.657 --> 01:16:01.991
Afternoon.

01:16:05.995 --> 01:16:07.539
Good afternoon.

01:16:08.123 --> 01:16:09.666
Do you have
a minute?

01:16:10.792 --> 01:16:12.419
Yes.

01:16:12.502 --> 01:16:14.629
How long did you
know Mr. Stone?

01:16:15.130 --> 01:16:16.923
Oh, a long time.
Why?

01:16:17.424 --> 01:16:19.217
Did he always
wear those clothes?

01:16:19.968 --> 01:16:21.928
What clothes?

01:16:23.471 --> 01:16:24.472
About there.

01:16:24.556 --> 01:16:27.392
Good. That's out of picture,
isn't it, boys?

01:16:28.143 --> 01:16:29.978
These are
his shoes. Heavy.

01:16:30.687 --> 01:16:32.147
Look at the soles
on them.

01:16:32.188 --> 01:16:34.482
Okay, that's fine.
Thank you.

01:16:35.233 --> 01:16:37.986
Oh, that was Harry.
He wasn't very stylish.

01:16:38.570 --> 01:16:40.739
No. No ltalian loafers
for him.

01:16:41.239 --> 01:16:42.866
Yeah, if he wore it,
it was durable.

01:16:42.949 --> 01:16:44.993
If it was nothing else,
it was durable.

01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:47.537
You know,
that's what struck me.

01:16:47.662 --> 01:16:49.497
It's the same
thing with his suit.

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:52.000
I checked with
the salesman and he says

01:16:52.083 --> 01:16:54.002
that's how they
sell these things.

01:16:54.044 --> 01:16:55.962
I mean, that's
their main feature.

01:16:56.004 --> 01:16:57.630
They never
wear out.

01:16:59.924 --> 01:17:01.468
Well, that's Harry.

01:17:01.551 --> 01:17:02.719
Tape is rolling.

01:17:02.802 --> 01:17:04.304
All right,
everybody, quiet please.

01:17:04.346 --> 01:17:05.971
This will be a take.

01:17:06.263 --> 01:17:09.433
"Hayward Campaign, Scene 3A.
Take one."

01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:11.393
Very quiet.

01:17:12.227 --> 01:17:13.771
Mr. Hayward, action.

01:17:15.856 --> 01:17:17.983
Good afternoon.
I'm Nelson Hayward.

01:17:18.025 --> 01:17:20.027
One of the major concerns
in our nation

01:17:20.110 --> 01:17:22.029
and in this state is crime.

01:17:22.154 --> 01:17:24.031
Many of us have been
its victims.

01:17:24.114 --> 01:17:25.449
Why do you ask?

01:17:25.532 --> 01:17:29.495
No, it just bothered
me because his watch

01:17:30.496 --> 01:17:32.456
doesn't match
with his clothes.

01:17:32.748 --> 01:17:34.708
Good afternoon,
I'm Nelson Hayward.

01:17:34.792 --> 01:17:36.335
Come again?

01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:38.003
Here's his watch.

01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:41.131
See, it's
a skinny little thing.

01:17:41.215 --> 01:17:42.841
It's easy to break.

01:17:44.134 --> 01:17:46.804
Don't mix with the shoes.
Oil and water.

01:17:47.262 --> 01:17:48.847
You follow
my meaning?

01:17:51.016 --> 01:17:53.018
You know, you're right,
because...

01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:54.061
Shh.

01:17:54.561 --> 01:17:57.690
To give us additional weapons
to fight against the thief.

01:17:57.773 --> 01:17:59.149
We better
get out of here

01:17:59.233 --> 01:18:00.734
before we both
get in trouble.

01:18:00.776 --> 01:18:02.236
Okay.
We'll go over there.

01:18:03.946 --> 01:18:05.989
If I'm elected to
the United States Senate,

01:18:06.073 --> 01:18:07.658
I would propose new, tough

01:18:07.741 --> 01:18:08.992
crime legislation.

01:18:09.076 --> 01:18:12.538
Crime on the streets
today is a brutal reality.

01:18:12.621 --> 01:18:14.873
And it's not gonna
stop until the criminal

01:18:14.915 --> 01:18:17.418
no longer feels that
the courts...

01:18:18.877 --> 01:18:21.380
Neither do I,
but it's interesting.

01:18:22.256 --> 01:18:24.008
Do you know that
I actually went

01:18:24.091 --> 01:18:25.342
to a jewelry store

01:18:25.426 --> 01:18:27.094
and I actually
brought these shoes

01:18:27.177 --> 01:18:28.637
and this suit
with me?

01:18:28.721 --> 01:18:31.098
Now I said
to the salesman,

01:18:31.223 --> 01:18:33.475
"Look, these are
very durable items.

01:18:33.934 --> 01:18:36.562
"Now suppose
the owner of these items

01:18:36.603 --> 01:18:38.147
"wanted the same
quality in his watch

01:18:38.230 --> 01:18:39.606
"that he had
in his shoes.

01:18:39.690 --> 01:18:41.400
What kind of
a watch would he buy?"

01:18:41.442 --> 01:18:43.277
You know, the guy
had an answer.

01:18:44.111 --> 01:18:45.446
Well, what did he say?

01:18:45.612 --> 01:18:46.947
I got it right here.

01:18:51.326 --> 01:18:54.079
Look at this watch.
You won't believe this.

01:18:58.125 --> 01:18:59.626
I intend to look after
the rights

01:18:59.668 --> 01:19:01.337
of these victims.

01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:03.297
You can't
break it.

01:19:03.339 --> 01:19:05.423
I don't care
what you do.

01:19:06.507 --> 01:19:08.301
He's still ticking.

01:19:11.387 --> 01:19:12.805
You're right.

01:19:16.684 --> 01:19:18.561
I don't know what all
this means, Lieutenant,

01:19:18.644 --> 01:19:19.771
but I agree with you.

01:19:19.854 --> 01:19:21.856
I think Harry would
buy that kind of a watch.

01:19:21.939 --> 01:19:23.608
Not that other
funny little thing.

01:19:23.649 --> 01:19:24.650
You do?

01:19:24.692 --> 01:19:25.735
Yeah.

01:19:25.818 --> 01:19:27.111
Mrs. Hayward,

01:19:27.653 --> 01:19:30.573
I'm gonna ask you
a question now.

01:19:30.656 --> 01:19:33.201
I'm afraid it's
gonna be unsettling,

01:19:33.284 --> 01:19:35.203
but I'm gonna ask it
anyhow.

01:19:36.871 --> 01:19:38.081
Go ahead.

01:19:38.164 --> 01:19:40.249
For
the criminal to run loose.

01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:42.126
I want the decent,

01:19:42.168 --> 01:19:44.879
law-abiding
citizen of this country

01:19:44.962 --> 01:19:47.799
to be able to walk
the streets without fear.

01:19:48.424 --> 01:19:49.842
This is Nelson Hayward.

01:19:49.926 --> 01:19:52.345
I would appreciate
your support. Thank you.

01:19:53.304 --> 01:19:54.889
Okay, cut.
Hold it. Thank you.

01:19:54.972 --> 01:19:56.182
We'll do it again,
boys.

01:19:56.265 --> 01:19:57.684
That was very good,
Mr. Hayward.

01:19:57.725 --> 01:20:00.186
But, uh, you kinda lost
concentration in the middle there.

01:20:00.269 --> 01:20:02.188
You were looking in the
direction of your wife.

01:20:02.271 --> 01:20:03.898
All right, all right.
Let's do it again.

01:20:03.981 --> 01:20:05.274
Right away, quick.

01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:12.031
Nelson.

01:20:12.115 --> 01:20:13.991
Nels, Nels,
we just got a break.

01:20:14.033 --> 01:20:15.243
One of the newsboys
leaked

01:20:15.326 --> 01:20:16.744
Davis' rebuttal
questions to us.

01:20:16.828 --> 01:20:18.329
They're dynamite.

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:20.540
We can have you
briefed in an hour.

01:20:20.581 --> 01:20:22.875
In a minute, in a minute.
I'll be, uh... Just one minute.

01:20:22.959 --> 01:20:24.293
I'll be right back.

01:20:27.046 --> 01:20:28.214
Yes, dear.

01:20:28.339 --> 01:20:31.217
Honey, that detective,
he wanted to know

01:20:31.467 --> 01:20:32.927
if at the night
of the party,

01:20:33.011 --> 01:20:35.388
if you left the room
between 9:15 and 9:30.

01:20:35.471 --> 01:20:36.973
Why did he
want to know that?

01:20:37.056 --> 01:20:39.183
I don't know what he's up to, darling.
Just ignore him.

01:20:39.225 --> 01:20:41.477
Honey, he's... he's a homicide
detective, he's not just...

01:20:41.561 --> 01:20:43.604
I know. Don't let him
upset you. Don't, don't.

01:20:43.688 --> 01:20:46.899
Okay. But he wanted to know
if... if you got along with Harry.

01:20:46.941 --> 01:20:48.860
All right. Pay no attention
to him, darling.

01:20:48.901 --> 01:20:49.902
You're getting
upset.

01:20:49.944 --> 01:20:52.280
Look, wait a minute. He said
it wasn't a political murder.

01:20:52.363 --> 01:20:53.740
That whoever
killed Harry...

01:20:53.823 --> 01:20:56.367
Listen, darling, I'm at the
peak of a political career.

01:20:56.451 --> 01:20:57.952
I'm under
enormous pressure.

01:20:58.077 --> 01:20:59.579
Someone
is trying to kill me.

01:20:59.662 --> 01:21:00.913
Now, that is a fact,
isn't it?

01:21:00.997 --> 01:21:02.998
I don't know what
the police are up to.

01:21:03.081 --> 01:21:04.750
Harry was killed
driving my car,

01:21:04.833 --> 01:21:06.460
in my clothes,
and in my garage.

01:21:06.543 --> 01:21:08.378
Do I have to get
gunned down in the streets

01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:09.963
before anybody
believes it?

01:21:10.047 --> 01:21:12.591
It's... it's... it's
difficult enough, darling.

01:21:12.674 --> 01:21:15.260
Don't make it any tougher than it is.
Huh? Okay?

01:21:17.012 --> 01:21:19.139
It's gonna be
all right, baby.

01:21:19.222 --> 01:21:21.099
I'll make it
all right.

01:21:21.141 --> 01:21:22.267
I'll make it all right.

01:22:05.185 --> 01:22:06.478
This is Larry Burrell

01:22:06.561 --> 01:22:08.188
at the headquarters
of Nelson Hayward,

01:22:08.271 --> 01:22:09.940
candidate for
the special election

01:22:10.023 --> 01:22:11.858
for United States Senator.

01:22:11.942 --> 01:22:14.319
The polls opened
at 7::00 this morning

01:22:14.361 --> 01:22:15.654
here in Los Angeles.

01:22:15.696 --> 01:22:17.906
And Registrar of Voters,
Roger Neufeld,

01:22:17.989 --> 01:22:20.909
is predicting
a 72%%% voter turnout

01:22:20.992 --> 01:22:23.954
which is exceptionally high
for an off-year election.

01:22:23.995 --> 01:22:25.831
There is a real
air of excitement

01:22:25.914 --> 01:22:27.416
here at Hayward headquarters

01:22:27.499 --> 01:22:29.501
as the last statewide poll
showed him leading

01:22:29.668 --> 01:22:31.503
by a margin of 8%%%.

01:22:31.545 --> 01:22:33.213
However, the "Get out
the vote" campaign

01:22:33.296 --> 01:22:35.173
continues in high gear

01:22:35.215 --> 01:22:37.676
with the, uh,
professional staff here

01:22:37.718 --> 01:22:39.344
coordinating with
volunteer groups

01:22:39.428 --> 01:22:40.512
throughout the county.

01:22:40.595 --> 01:22:43.015
We'll be bringing you
Election Day highlights

01:22:43.098 --> 01:22:44.349
on the noon news,
and of course

01:22:44.391 --> 01:22:46.268
starting at 5:00 p.m.,

01:22:46.351 --> 01:22:47.936
we'll stay with
the voting results

01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:49.688
until the final tabulations
are made.

01:22:49.896 --> 01:22:53.108
This is Larry Burrell
at Hayward headquarters.

01:22:58.363 --> 01:23:00.489
Send in Miss Johnson, please.

01:23:13.044 --> 01:23:14.628
Good morning, darling.

01:23:15.129 --> 01:23:16.380
That's for luck.

01:23:16.505 --> 01:23:17.715
And I could use some.

01:23:21.594 --> 01:23:23.179
Is something wrong?

01:23:23.929 --> 01:23:25.514
Election Day.

01:23:26.766 --> 01:23:28.184
Well, what is it?

01:23:28.225 --> 01:23:30.394
Nothing I want you to
worry over, darling.

01:23:32.313 --> 01:23:34.231
Come on, now.
There is something wrong.

01:23:34.357 --> 01:23:36.233
Now tell me.
What is it? Please.

01:23:42.907 --> 01:23:45.076
Come and take
a look at this.

01:23:56.671 --> 01:23:57.713
Oh, no.

01:23:57.755 --> 01:23:59.090
Easy, darling.

01:23:59.173 --> 01:24:01.133
Oh, Nelson,
before Harry was killed,

01:24:01.217 --> 01:24:02.510
there was
a possibility that

01:24:02.593 --> 01:24:04.553
these were just idle threats,
but not now.

01:24:04.595 --> 01:24:06.055
Where did you
find it?

01:24:06.097 --> 01:24:07.431
On my desk this morning.

01:24:07.515 --> 01:24:09.100
Well, haven't you told
the police yet?

01:24:09.183 --> 01:24:10.184
Oh, no.

01:24:10.267 --> 01:24:11.394
Linda, I'm scared.

01:24:11.477 --> 01:24:12.978
Well, I should
think so.

01:24:13.062 --> 01:24:14.647
Darling, no, no,
don't you understand?

01:24:14.730 --> 01:24:16.232
The police
aren't going to help.

01:24:16.315 --> 01:24:17.692
Lt. Columbo thinks

01:24:17.775 --> 01:24:18.984
that all the threats
were fake

01:24:19.068 --> 01:24:20.361
just for sympathy
and publicity.

01:24:20.444 --> 01:24:21.404
What?

01:24:21.487 --> 01:24:22.571
They're never
gonna believe

01:24:22.655 --> 01:24:25.449
that I didn't just plant
this thing here myself.

01:24:25.491 --> 01:24:27.201
I tell you,
if just somebody else

01:24:27.284 --> 01:24:28.577
would have found it.

01:24:32.707 --> 01:24:34.792
The police will
never believe me.

01:24:35.835 --> 01:24:36.877
All right,
I found it.

01:24:36.961 --> 01:24:37.962
No, no,
darling.

01:24:38.045 --> 01:24:39.171
I found it
just now.

01:24:39.255 --> 01:24:40.631
No, it's best
you stay out of it.

01:24:40.715 --> 01:24:42.341
Nelson, I'm not going
to stand here

01:24:42.425 --> 01:24:44.468
and watch you
murdered like Harry.

01:24:48.472 --> 01:24:50.850
Ask Sgt. Vernon to
come in here, please.

01:24:52.852 --> 01:24:54.770
Mr. Hayward,
one question, please.

01:24:54.812 --> 01:24:57.439
Sorry, guys, no more speeches.
Now it's up to the people.

01:24:57.522 --> 01:25:00.108
It's not political, it's this
latest threat on your life.

01:25:00.191 --> 01:25:01.276
Any comment on that?

01:25:01.317 --> 01:25:03.319
Well, of course I'm concerned,
it's obviously

01:25:03.361 --> 01:25:05.280
from the same source
as all the others.

01:25:05.321 --> 01:25:07.657
Happily, I'm... I'm
well guarded.

01:25:07.699 --> 01:25:09.576
You have any
special plans for the day?

01:25:09.659 --> 01:25:11.870
Well, just to hang around
the suite for a few hours.

01:25:11.953 --> 01:25:14.080
And later, Mrs. Hayward
and I are going out and vote.

01:25:14.164 --> 01:25:15.332
I'm not that confident.

01:25:15.415 --> 01:25:17.792
So if I win by two votes,
you'll know whose those were.

01:25:20.337 --> 01:25:21.379
Where's Columbo?

01:25:21.463 --> 01:25:22.630
He's in the press room.

01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:29.471
Lieutenant?

01:25:29.596 --> 01:25:30.638
Yeah.

01:25:30.847 --> 01:25:31.806
Lieutenant?

01:25:31.890 --> 01:25:32.891
Yeah.

01:25:33.016 --> 01:25:35.352
Mr. Hayward is back
in his suite, sir.

01:25:40.690 --> 01:25:42.817
Oh, Sergeant!
Sergeant!

01:25:43.526 --> 01:25:44.944
Yes, sir?

01:25:45.028 --> 01:25:47.781
Listen, uh, you let me know
if Mr. Hayward is ever alone.

01:25:47.864 --> 01:25:49.908
Oh, no, we won't leave
him alone, sir.

01:25:49.991 --> 01:25:52.035
No, I mean,
if he goes to the bathroom,

01:25:52.118 --> 01:25:54.162
you know, to take
a shower or something.

01:25:54.204 --> 01:25:55.538
All right,
right, sir.

01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:04.297
And from the Los Angeles
County Registrar

01:26:04.422 --> 01:26:06.341
we have word that 42%%%

01:26:06.383 --> 01:26:08.718
of the registered voters
have already turned out.

01:26:08.802 --> 01:26:10.762
Which is
unusually heavy voting

01:26:10.845 --> 01:26:12.764
for this early hour
in a special election.

01:26:12.931 --> 01:26:14.557
It looks like
we may be headed

01:26:14.683 --> 01:26:15.975
for some kind of a record.

01:26:16.059 --> 01:26:20.021
San Diego County also reports
a heavy turnout, and 36%%%

01:26:20.063 --> 01:26:22.107
of registered voters
having already voted.

01:26:22.190 --> 01:26:25.402
Bad weather in San Francisco
and some northern counties

01:26:25.443 --> 01:26:28.655
have kept the totals low
there so far

01:26:28.738 --> 01:26:31.866
with only 25%%% reporting
in San Francisco

01:26:31.908 --> 01:26:33.493
and Alameda counties.

01:26:33.576 --> 01:26:34.869
The Orange County vote

01:26:34.911 --> 01:26:36.538
looks to be
exceptionally high

01:26:36.579 --> 01:26:38.540
with over 50%%% of
registered voters

01:26:38.581 --> 01:26:40.500
having cast
their ballots so far.

01:26:42.544 --> 01:26:43.962
What's in the case,
please, ma'am?

01:26:44.045 --> 01:26:45.630
Uh, Mr. Hayward's
asked me to bring it

01:26:45.714 --> 01:26:46.715
from his office.

01:26:46.798 --> 01:26:47.757
Is it locked?

01:26:47.799 --> 01:26:48.800
I don't know.

01:26:48.883 --> 01:26:50.552
Would you
try it, please?

01:26:51.261 --> 01:26:52.679
I'll have to
take a look into it.

01:26:52.762 --> 01:26:53.805
Mr. Hayward's
orders, ma'am.

01:26:53.888 --> 01:26:55.889
Everything and everybody
coming into this suite

01:26:55.973 --> 01:26:57.016
has to be searched.

01:26:57.099 --> 01:26:59.727
Miss Dodds.
I'm sorry.

01:26:59.768 --> 01:27:00.769
Perfectly all right.

01:27:00.853 --> 01:27:03.147
I'm glad they're
taking so much precaution.

01:27:12.239 --> 01:27:14.366
According, uh, to
the most recent polls,

01:27:14.450 --> 01:27:16.452
the youth vote
is not expected

01:27:16.535 --> 01:27:19.246
to play a significant role
in this election.

01:27:19.288 --> 01:27:20.789
Both candidates
register strongly

01:27:20.873 --> 01:27:21.915
with young people,

01:27:21.957 --> 01:27:24.710
but a general apathy
toward this election

01:27:24.793 --> 01:27:27.796
seems to have surfaced
on most college campuses.

01:27:28.422 --> 01:27:30.507
We're now getting
some further word

01:27:30.591 --> 01:27:32.760
from the Registrar of Voters
in San Francisco.

01:27:33.177 --> 01:27:35.679
The turnout has
increased dramatically

01:27:35.763 --> 01:27:38.223
and the percentage total
so far...

01:27:38.307 --> 01:27:40.017
Mr. Hayward,
a lady brought this

01:27:40.100 --> 01:27:41.101
from your office.

01:27:41.185 --> 01:27:42.436
She's being searched.

01:27:42.478 --> 01:27:43.604
Miss Johnson?

01:27:43.645 --> 01:27:45.856
No exceptions,
Mr. Hayward. You agreed.

01:27:45.939 --> 01:27:48.442
Okay, okay. You... you guys
mind if I go in there

01:27:48.525 --> 01:27:50.027
and make a few
private phone calls?

01:27:50.110 --> 01:27:51.195
Certainly not.

01:27:51.278 --> 01:27:53.155
lead that is expected
in San Diego

01:27:53.197 --> 01:27:54.531
and Orange County.

01:27:54.907 --> 01:27:56.325
Davis and Hayward
were considered

01:27:56.367 --> 01:27:57.534
by most pollsters

01:27:57.618 --> 01:28:00.329
to be running very close
in Los Angeles.

01:28:00.412 --> 01:28:01.789
And those votes may turn out

01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:03.707
to be a determining factor
in this election.

01:28:03.791 --> 01:28:05.793
Well, there's no way
anybody can get out there

01:28:05.876 --> 01:28:06.960
from the next suite,

01:28:07.002 --> 01:28:08.504
but I wish you'd
stayed inside, sir.

01:28:08.587 --> 01:28:09.505
Surely.

01:28:09.546 --> 01:28:12.007
People in over two dozen
key precincts around

01:28:12.049 --> 01:28:13.592
Los Angeles County.

01:28:13.676 --> 01:28:17.346
And, uh, I'm just learning
from those precincts

01:28:17.429 --> 01:28:20.974
that East Los Angeles
is turning out for Davis

01:28:21.058 --> 01:28:25.020
with, uh, 48%%% of
the vote projected so far.

01:28:25.521 --> 01:28:28.023
West Los Angeles
and Beverly Hills

01:28:28.107 --> 01:28:31.151
reporting 42%%% of
the votes accounted...

01:28:31.235 --> 01:28:32.861
All secure, sir.

01:28:32.945 --> 01:28:34.697
And the West Valley
has so far reported

01:28:34.780 --> 01:28:36.156
a turnout of 51%%%.

01:28:54.298 --> 01:28:55.466
Hello.

01:28:56.509 --> 01:28:57.510
Yeah.

01:28:57.593 --> 01:28:58.886
Lieutenant.

01:29:00.221 --> 01:29:01.723
Sgt. Vernon.

01:29:03.057 --> 01:29:04.058
Oh.

01:29:09.022 --> 01:29:10.064
Yeah.

01:29:10.148 --> 01:29:12.066
The candidate's in
his bedroom alone.

01:29:12.191 --> 01:29:14.027
He had some
personal calls to make.

01:29:14.527 --> 01:29:15.737
Right.

01:30:08.998 --> 01:30:10.541
Davis and Hayward

01:30:10.625 --> 01:30:12.085
were considered
by most pollsters...

01:30:12.168 --> 01:30:13.920
Miss Johnson,
would you please take this

01:30:13.961 --> 01:30:15.797
to the office and
lock it in the safe?

01:30:15.838 --> 01:30:17.048
Oh, yes.

01:30:17.715 --> 01:30:19.258
I'm sorry about
that search before.

01:30:19.300 --> 01:30:20.593
I'm not.

01:30:21.636 --> 01:30:23.012
You will, uh,
join us later?

01:30:23.096 --> 01:30:24.180
Yes.

01:30:25.598 --> 01:30:26.724
Thursday,
I'd be happy...

01:30:26.808 --> 01:30:27.850
Vicki?

01:30:29.477 --> 01:30:30.520
Hello, Linda.

01:30:30.645 --> 01:30:31.688
Hello.

01:30:33.314 --> 01:30:35.483
Oh, Mrs. Hayward,
will you be, uh, needing me

01:30:35.566 --> 01:30:37.068
anymore
this afternoon?

01:30:38.569 --> 01:30:41.406
No, but I'm sure
that Nelson will.

01:30:42.490 --> 01:30:43.616
Thank you.

01:30:43.700 --> 01:30:46.285
West Los Angeles
and Beverly Hills

01:30:46.369 --> 01:30:48.705
are reporting
42%%% of the votes

01:30:48.788 --> 01:30:49.789
accounted for.

01:30:50.164 --> 01:30:53.125
I assume we'll be, uh,
voting together.

01:30:53.792 --> 01:30:56.670
Oh, yes, yes, of course,
darling. Right now.

01:31:01.425 --> 01:31:02.551
Columbo.

01:31:02.634 --> 01:31:03.510
We're just leaving

01:31:03.593 --> 01:31:05.345
with the candidate
and his wife, to vote.

01:31:16.398 --> 01:31:17.816
Good luck, sir!

01:31:34.624 --> 01:31:35.751
Dd

01:31:48.347 --> 01:31:49.514
Good luck.

01:31:56.188 --> 01:31:59.191
Thank you very much.
Nice to see you.

01:31:59.566 --> 01:32:01.026
How wonderful to see you.

01:32:04.029 --> 01:32:06.573
San Francisco and
other Bay Area communities...

01:32:06.657 --> 01:32:07.991
Good luck.

01:32:09.534 --> 01:32:12.079
Reporting that tabulations
are now underway

01:32:12.162 --> 01:32:14.289
and we should be getting...

01:32:16.249 --> 01:32:18.835
statewide results,
and let me remind you

01:32:18.919 --> 01:32:20.921
that these are
early scattered returns.

01:32:21.004 --> 01:32:22.714
We're not even
projecting a winner

01:32:22.756 --> 01:32:24.633
in most of these precincts.

01:32:25.217 --> 01:32:29.262
Fresno now with 28 precincts
recording 5,434.

01:32:41.858 --> 01:32:43.318
I'm sorry
about the search.

01:32:43.402 --> 01:32:44.861
I wouldn't have
minded so much

01:32:44.945 --> 01:32:46.571
had it been you
instead of her.

01:32:46.947 --> 01:32:48.448
Victoria.

01:32:48.615 --> 01:32:50.157
Hello, Lucy.

01:32:50.491 --> 01:32:52.201
What a wonderful,
wonderful day.

01:32:52.284 --> 01:32:53.494
Lucy.

01:32:53.577 --> 01:32:54.870
How are you?

01:32:54.954 --> 01:32:58.124
Davis, 1, 138, Hayward, 2,014.

01:32:58.249 --> 01:33:02.086
Visalia, 9 precincts
reporting, Davis, 411,

01:33:02.128 --> 01:33:04.046
Hayward, 505.

01:33:04.130 --> 01:33:07.258
Humboldt, with, uh,
4 precincts reporting,

01:33:07.299 --> 01:33:09.760
Hayward, 211, Davis, 202,

01:33:10.094 --> 01:33:13.597
Sacramento, 31 precincts
reporting, Davis, 4, 200,

01:33:13.681 --> 01:33:16.017
Hayward, 3,460...

01:33:56.182 --> 01:33:57.892
Out there!
Out there!

01:34:00.895 --> 01:34:02.146
I'm all right.

01:34:02.188 --> 01:34:04.148
This is Mrs. Hayward,
leave her be. I'm fine!

01:34:04.231 --> 01:34:05.358
I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:34:06.108 --> 01:34:07.902
Please tell everybody
I'll be all right!

01:34:07.985 --> 01:34:09.653
Get some men in
that next room.

01:34:09.779 --> 01:34:11.447
Quiet down out there!

01:34:11.530 --> 01:34:12.990
Everything's under control!

01:34:13.032 --> 01:34:14.533
I sat down here

01:34:14.617 --> 01:34:16.202
and I started to
make a phone call

01:34:16.285 --> 01:34:18.329
and moved my head
a little closer to the dial...

01:34:18.412 --> 01:34:19.747
He fired from out there.

01:34:19.830 --> 01:34:20.998
All I could see was a figure.

01:34:21.082 --> 01:34:22.750
Get two men in that
suite next door.

01:34:22.833 --> 01:34:24.669
After that,
get this hotel surrounded.

01:34:24.710 --> 01:34:26.170
Nobody leaves.

01:34:27.004 --> 01:34:29.840
Whoever it was, Mr. Hayward,
has to have been a human fly.

01:34:29.882 --> 01:34:32.468
I don't know how he managed
that, uh, ledge out there.

01:34:32.551 --> 01:34:33.803
You don't believe
anybody else

01:34:33.886 --> 01:34:35.054
was in this room?

01:34:35.137 --> 01:34:36.889
Oh, please, sir,
I didn't mean to imply...

01:34:36.931 --> 01:34:38.432
That's exactly
what you're implying!

01:34:38.516 --> 01:34:40.601
I'm getting sick and tired
of police innuendo!

01:34:40.685 --> 01:34:42.228
I mean
if I fired the shot,

01:34:42.311 --> 01:34:44.355
wouldn't there still be
a gun here in the room?

01:34:44.397 --> 01:34:46.023
Or on me or found
in the streets below?

01:34:46.107 --> 01:34:47.107
Now, please, Mr...

01:34:47.190 --> 01:34:48.441
Why don't you
search for it?

01:34:48.525 --> 01:34:50.193
Just search for a gun!
Go on. I insist!

01:34:50.235 --> 01:34:51.945
You start right now with me!
Here, here.

01:34:52.028 --> 01:34:53.530
All my friends here,
my wife,

01:34:53.571 --> 01:34:54.906
and everybody
here in this suite!

01:34:54.990 --> 01:34:56.282
Make room.
Let the Lieutenant in.

01:34:56.366 --> 01:34:57.325
Step aside.

01:34:57.409 --> 01:34:58.410
It's me, Sergeant.

01:34:58.493 --> 01:34:59.911
Get him in here.

01:34:59.995 --> 01:35:01.746
Somebody just took
a shot at Mr. Hayward.

01:35:01.788 --> 01:35:03.164
Yeah, I heard.
Now I told Rojas

01:35:03.248 --> 01:35:05.250
to forget about
surrounding the building

01:35:05.333 --> 01:35:07.627
because the guy that fired that
shot is still in this room.

01:35:07.711 --> 01:35:08.712
What?

01:35:08.795 --> 01:35:09.754
What's he
talking about?

01:35:09.796 --> 01:35:11.673
It's all right,
It's all right, everybody!

01:35:12.048 --> 01:35:13.299
He means me!

01:35:14.718 --> 01:35:15.719
You?

01:35:15.802 --> 01:35:16.761
Isn't that right?

01:35:17.846 --> 01:35:18.930
Yes, sir.

01:35:19.097 --> 01:35:20.181
Just as I figured.

01:35:20.765 --> 01:35:23.059
It's exactly
what I thought you'd say.

01:35:25.603 --> 01:35:27.772
I fired the shot,
is that it?

01:35:28.398 --> 01:35:30.900
Lt. Columbo,
was there a gun in this room?

01:35:31.609 --> 01:35:33.445
I wouldn't say so,
sir. No.

01:35:33.945 --> 01:35:36.656
I mean would you concede
there's no gun in the room?

01:35:36.740 --> 01:35:37.907
Yes, sir.

01:35:37.991 --> 01:35:39.576
All right,
let me show you something.

01:35:39.784 --> 01:35:41.244
Is this a bullet
hole in the glass?

01:35:41.286 --> 01:35:42.412
Yes, sir.

01:35:42.454 --> 01:35:44.664
Would you say
it was fired at an angle

01:35:44.789 --> 01:35:46.833
calculated to hit
a victim in the head

01:35:46.916 --> 01:35:48.752
here seated
at the phone in this chair?

01:35:48.793 --> 01:35:49.919
Yes, sir.

01:35:50.003 --> 01:35:51.504
And would you say that,

01:35:51.588 --> 01:35:53.298
having failed to hit
the intended victim,

01:35:53.381 --> 01:35:55.425
the trajectory indicates
that this hole in the wall

01:35:55.467 --> 01:35:57.093
was caused by
the spent bullet?

01:35:57.135 --> 01:35:58.470
Yes, sir.

01:35:58.511 --> 01:36:00.847
And would you further concede
that if this bullet

01:36:00.930 --> 01:36:03.641
proves to be from the same gun
that killed Harry Stone,

01:36:03.683 --> 01:36:05.685
then the same hand
fired both shots?

01:36:05.769 --> 01:36:06.728
Yes, sir.

01:36:06.811 --> 01:36:08.855
Then all that remains for you
is to dig the bullet

01:36:08.938 --> 01:36:11.441
out of the wall and take it to
Ballistics for a comparison!

01:36:11.483 --> 01:36:12.734
No, sir.

01:36:14.819 --> 01:36:17.530
I've already dug
the bullet out of the wall

01:36:17.822 --> 01:36:19.949
and Ballistics
has already verified

01:36:19.991 --> 01:36:21.826
that it came
from the same gun.

01:36:27.165 --> 01:36:28.500
Here's the bullet.

01:36:31.670 --> 01:36:33.630
Here is
the ballistics report.

01:36:34.589 --> 01:36:37.717
No bullets in the wall.
Bullet's right here.

01:36:38.843 --> 01:36:40.553
It's in
my handkerchief.

01:36:43.348 --> 01:36:44.849
There she is.

01:36:46.225 --> 01:36:49.186
You see, sir, this afternoon
when you told Sgt. Vernon

01:36:49.228 --> 01:36:50.688
that you were going
to come in here

01:36:50.729 --> 01:36:52.314
to make some
private phone calls,

01:36:52.356 --> 01:36:54.066
I was over there
in the press room.

01:36:54.149 --> 01:36:57.778
Now this room is 615,
and the press room is 616.

01:36:58.404 --> 01:37:01.991
When you call from here,
it lights up over there

01:37:02.700 --> 01:37:03.826
because you installed

01:37:03.909 --> 01:37:05.703
that special
three-way rotary system.

01:37:07.204 --> 01:37:10.541
So I kept watching the phone
for 615 to light up.

01:37:11.875 --> 01:37:14.003
Yeah, it's lit up now.
Can you see that?

01:37:14.211 --> 01:37:16.839
I kept waiting for
that button to light up.

01:37:20.509 --> 01:37:21.927
It never lit up.

01:37:22.428 --> 01:37:24.888
I didn't know what the hell
you were doing here.

01:37:24.972 --> 01:37:27.057
I knew you
weren't makin' a call.

01:37:28.517 --> 01:37:29.977
And I confess,
I got curious.

01:37:30.060 --> 01:37:32.396
And when you and your wife,
when you went to vote,

01:37:32.479 --> 01:37:34.398
I took advantage
of that opportunity

01:37:34.523 --> 01:37:36.400
to come in here
and look around.

01:37:37.109 --> 01:37:39.445
I found that bullet hole
in the glass door

01:37:39.528 --> 01:37:41.071
and that took me
to the wall.

01:37:43.907 --> 01:37:46.744
I dug this bullet
out of that wall

01:37:46.827 --> 01:37:48.662
three hours before
you said that

01:37:48.746 --> 01:37:50.706
somebody fired it at you
three minutes ago.

01:38:02.926 --> 01:38:04.636
You're under arrest, sir.
